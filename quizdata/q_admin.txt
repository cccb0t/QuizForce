Customer service accesses articles with the Knowledge Lightning component on the Service Cloud Console. Billing department users would like similar functionality on the case record without using the console. How should the administrator configure this request? 
*Add the knowledge component to the page layout.
Add the Knowledge related list to the page layout.
Add the knowledge related list to the record page
Explanation: The correct answer is A. Add the knowledge component to the page layout. This is because the question specifically mentions that the billing department users would like similar functionality on the case record without using the console. Adding the knowledge component to the page layout would allow the billing department users to access articles without having to use the Service Cloud Console. Option B, adding the Knowledge related list to the page layout, would not provide the same functionality as the Knowledge Lightning component. Option C, adding the knowledge related list to the record page, is also not the best solution as it would only display a list of articles and not provide the full functionality of the Knowledge Lightning component. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000383725&amp;type=1 

The administrator at Northern Trail Outfitters has been using a spreadsheet to track assigned licenses and permission sets. What feature can be used to track this in Salesforce? 
Login History
Lightning Usage App
*User Report
Permission Set Groups
Explanation: C. To track assigned licenses and permission sets in Salesforce instead of using a spreadsheet, an administrator should use User Report type on Report object. User Report type allows creating reports that show information about users such as their profile, role, license type, active status, login history etc. It also allows adding fields related to permission sets such as Permission Set Assignments or Permission Set License Assignments. For example, an administrator can create a User Report that shows user name, profile name, user license name, permission set assignments count etc. Login History, Lightning Usage App, or Permission Set Groups are not features that can be used to track assigned licenses and permission sets in Salesforce. Reference: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.reports_report_types_standard_user.htm&amp;type=5

Cloud Kicks (CK) needs a new sales application. The administrator knows there is an application package on the AppExchange and wants to begin testing it in a sandbox to see if it addresses CK's needs. What are two considerations when installing a managed package in a sandbox? Choose 2 answers.  
Any metadata changes to the package have to be recreated in production.
*The installation link has to be modified to test.salesforce.com.
Install for Admins Only will be the only Install option available.
*The package will be removed any time the sandbox is refreshed.
Explanation: B,D Two considerations when installing a managed package in a sandbox are: The installation link has to be modified to test.salesforce.com, because the default installation link points to login.salesforce.com which is for production orgs. To install a package in a sandbox org, the administrator has to replace login with test in the installation URL before clicking it. The package will be removed any time the sandbox is refreshed, because refreshing a sandbox replaces its current data and metadata with those from its source org. If the source org does not have the package installed, then the sandbox will lose it after refresh. Any metadata changes to the package do not have to be recreated in production, because they are preserved during upgrades unless overwritten by the package developer. Install for Admins Only is not the only install option available; there are also Install for All Users and Install for Specific Profiles options.

Cloud Kicks (CK) captures whether an opportunity should be reviewed by someone in product engineering with a checkbox field called Needs Review. CK also has a picklist field on the opportunity for Product Type. When a sales rep saves an opportunity, they need to select the Product Type or check the Needs Review box. What should an administrator use to accomplish this?  
Before Save flow
*Validation rule
Workflow rule
Required fields

The administrator at Cloud Kicks writes an assignment rule to send all cases created via email or the web to the Automated Cases Queue. Any manually created cases should be owned by the agent creating them, however, the manually created cases now show the administrator as the owner. What will the administrator find when troubleshooting this issue? 
An escalation rule is changing the case owner on case creation
The Assignment Rule checkbox is selected by default.
*Another assignment rule is giving ownership to the administrator
The Owner field is missing on the webform and email template.
Explanation: C is the correct answer because it suggests that there is another assignment rule that is conflicting with the first assignment rule and giving ownership to the administrator. This is the most likely scenario as the first rule was specifically created to send cases created via email or web to the Automated Cases Queue. Option A is incorrect because it suggests that an escalation rule is changing the owner, which is not related to the assignment rule issue described. Option B is also incorrect because it suggests that a checkbox is causing the issue when in reality it is likely a conflicting assignment rule. Option D is not related to the issue described in the question.

DreamHouse Realty requires that house showings be scheduled within the current year to prevent too many future showings from stacking up. How can they make sure Showing Date is only populated with a date this year? 
Sync the users' Showing Calendar to Salesforce and filter it to only look at this year.
Create a report that shows any Showing Dates not scheduled in the current year to the updated.
Add Help Text so the user knows to only add a Showing Date within the current year.
*Create a validation rule that ensures Showing Date contains a date within the current year.
Explanation: The correct answer is D because it proposes a solution that directly addresses the requirement of DreamHouse Realty to prevent future showings from stacking up by validating that the Showing Date contains a date within the current year. Options A, B, and C do not provide a validation mechanism to ensure that only the current year's Showing Dates are scheduled, which is the requirement of DreamHouse Realty. Option A suggests filtering the users' Showing Calendar, which may not guarantee that only current year's Showing Dates are scheduled. Option B proposes a report that identifies Showing Dates not scheduled in the current year, but it doesn't prevent users from scheduling future dates. Option C adds help text to guide users to enter Showing Dates within the current year, but it does not prevent users from entering future dates or incorrectly formatted dates. Therefore, D is the most appropriate solution that fulfills DreamHouse Realty's requirement.

Brokers at DreamHouse Realty need to see certain information about one or more cases when referencing the contact record. This record case includes Name, Case ID, Customer Name, Case Reason, Case Status, and Case Creation Date. Which two changes in Setup should the administrator make? 
Use the page layout editor to change the related list type to Enhanced List.
*Edit the Related List component in the Lightning App Builder and choose Related List as the related list type.
Edit the Related List component in the Lightning App Builder and choose Enhanced List as the related list type.
*Use the page layout editor to include the appropriate column in the Cases related list.
Explanation: B and D is the correct answer for this question because option B suggests editing the Related List component in the Lightning App Builder and choosing the Related List as the related list type, which will allow the brokers to view the required information about the cases when referencing the contact record. Option D suggests using the page layout editor to include the appropriate column in the cases related list, which will also enable the brokers to view the required information about the cases when referencing the contact record. 
Option A is incorrect because it suggests changing the related list type to Enhanced List, which may not necessarily show the required information about the cases.
Option C is incorrect because it suggests choosing Enhanced List as the related list type, which may not necessarily show the required information about the cases.

The Support team at Ursa Major Solar prefers using split list views on the case homepage. Occasionally, the team views shipments from another support application. What should the administrator configure to allow the team to use the split list view? 
Filter by a single shipment record type in the list view.
*Include the Shipments tab on the app's navigation bar.
Split views are only available on standard objects.
Add the Manage List Views permission for support users.
Explanation: The correct answer is B. To allow the team to use the split list view for shipments from another support application in Salesforce, the administrator should pin the Shipment object to the navigation bar. Once pinned, users can access the Split View by changing the “Display As” setting on a list view. This setting can be changed back and forth as needed. The default view for each Object is Table View.
Option A is incorrect as it only suggests filtering by a single shipment record type in the list view, but it does not address the issue of enabling split list views. 
Option C is incorrect as it is a false statement. As stated above, split views are available for custom objects as well as standard objects. 
Option D is irrelevant to the question as it refers to the Manage List Views permission for support users, but it does not address the specific issue of enabling split list views for the Support team at Ursa Major Solar.

Cloud Kicks generates leads for its different product categories (shoes, apparel, and accessories) through many different sources. While some lead sources are used for all three categories, other lead sources are specific to a single category. The VP of marketing requests that only the proper lead sources be displayed based on the product category chosen. How should the administrator configure Salesforce to meet this requirement? 
Create a page layout for each category and filter the Lead Source field based on category.
Create a dependency between the Product Category field and Lead Source field.
Create business processes and record types for each of the three product categories.
*Create a single business process, then create record types for each product category.
Explanation: D is the correct answer because creating a single business process and then creating record types for each product category will allow for conditional display of Lead Source fields based on the selected product category. This approach ensures consistent data entry and reduces the potential for errors as compared to creating separate page layouts or dependencies for each product category. Option A may result in duplication of page layouts and maintenance overhead. Option B may require continuous updates when new lead sources are added. Option C is not the optimal solution as it may result in redundant business processes and record types for each product category. https://www.siloconnectors.com/blog/how-to-create-salesforce-record-types-and-business-processes/#:~:text=Create%20a%20Business%20Process&amp;text=Navigate%20to%20Setup%20%3E%3E%20Type%20“,Press%20New. 

The CTO of AW Computing has defined a new policy for cases to improve customer satisfaction. All cases submitted with a Case Reason of Installation must be acknowledged immediately via email and assigned to the appropriate agents. Any cases that are still in the New status after 4 hours must be escalated to support management. What case management tools need to be utilized for this requirement? 
Auto-response rules, Macros, Entitlements
Auto-response rules, Queues, Macros
*Auto-response rules, Queues, Escalation Rules
Auto-response rules, Entitlements, Escalation Rules
Explanation: The correct answer is C. According to the given requirement, cases with the Case Reason of Installation need to be acknowledged immediately via email and assigned to appropriate agents. This can be achieved by using an Auto-response rule. Additionally, cases that are still in the New status after 4 hours must be escalated to support management. This can be achieved by using an Escalation Rule. Finally, the cases should be assigned to appropriate agents, which can be achieved by using Queues. Therefore, the correct combination of case management tools that need to be utilized for this requirement is Auto-response rules, Queues, and Escalation Rules. Option A, B, and D are incorrect as they do not include all the required case management tools as per the given requirement.

DreamHouse Realty regularly holds open houses for the selling of both houses and condominiums. For condominium open houses, there are a few extra steps that need to be taken. Agents need to be able to submit requests and receive approvals from the homeowners' association. How can the administrator ensure these extra steps only appear when creating open house records for condominiums? 
Create one page layout. Use record types to ensure the proper status picklist values display.
*Create two page layouts. Use business processes and record types to display the appropriate picklist values.
Create one page layout. Use business processes to ensure the proper status picklist values display.
Create two page layouts, one with a House Status field and the other with a Condominium Status field.
Explanation: The correct answer is B because it suggests creating two page layouts, which will allow different fields and picklist values to be displayed for condominium and house open houses. Additionally, using business processes in combination with record types can further ensure that only the appropriate picklist values are displayed for each type of open house. Option A only suggests using record types but does not address the need for different fields and picklist values. Option C suggests using business processes but does not address the need for separate page layouts. Option D suggests creating two page layouts but does not address the need for different picklist values.

What should an administrator use as an identifier when importing and updating records from a separate system? Choose 1 option. 
Rich Text field
Record ID
Auto-Number field
*External ID
Explanation: D is the correct answer because an external ID is a unique identifier that can be used to match records between Salesforce and another system. It is commonly used when importing or updating records from a separate system. A rich text field and auto-number field cannot be used as identifiers for this task. The record ID can be used for updating records within Salesforce, but not when importing from a separate system.

Ursa Major Solar wants its sales reps to be aware when they are speaking with high-profile customers. Which two options should be added to the Lightning record pages to achieve this? Choose 2 answers.  
Custom Component
*Highlight Panel
Action and Recommendations
*Component Visibility Filter
Rich Text Area
Explanation: B is the correct answer because a Highlight Panel can be used to display important information to users when certain criteria are met, such as when speaking with a high-profile customer. This makes it easier for sales reps to quickly identify and prioritize their interactions. 
D is also correct because a Component Visibility Filter can be used to conditionally hide/show a component based on specific criteria, such as the user profile or the record type. This means that the sales reps can have a customized record page that only displays the relevant information when they are interacting with high-profile customers, allowing for a more efficient and effective sales process. 
A, C, and E are incorrect because they do not directly address the requirement of identifying high-profile customers during a sales interaction. A Custom Component and Rich Text Area may provide additional information, but they do not specifically highlight or filter for high-profile customers. Action and Recommendations may suggest certain actions based on the record data, but they do not help identify high-profile customers during a sales interaction.

Universal Containers has a private sharing model for Opportunities and uses Opportunity Teams. Criteria-based sharing rules are not used. A sales rep at Universal Containers leaves the company and their user record is deactivated. The rep is later rehired in the same firm. The Salesforce administrator activates the old user record. The user is added to the same default Opportunity Teams, but is no longer able to see the same records the user worked on before leaving the company. What is the likely cause? 
The stage of the Opportunity records was changed to closed lost.
Permission sets were removed when the user was deactivated.
The record type of the Opportunity records was changed.
*The records were manual shared with the user.
Explanation: The likely cause is that the records were manually shared with the user. When a user is deactivated and then reactivated, they are assigned a new user ID. This means that any manual sharing that was done with the old user ID is no longer valid.

Marketing users at Cloud Kicks should be able to view and edit converted leads. The administrator has assigned them permission set with the View and edit Converted Leads permission. Which two ways can the marketing users now access converted leads for editing? 
Utilize a list view where lead status equals Qualified.
Use the Data Import Wizard,
*Find them in the global search result.
*Search the Recent Records component on the homepage.
Explanation: C,D https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.leads_view_edit_converted.htm&amp;type=5

What data loss considerations should an administrator keep in mind when changing a custom field type from Text to Picklist? Choose 2 answers.  
There will be no data loss with use of a global value set.
*Assignment and escalation rules may be affected.
Auto updates will be made to Visualforce references to prevent data loss.
*Any list view based on the custom field that will be deleted.
Explanation: B is correct because when changing a custom field type from Text to Picklist, any existing assignment and escalation rules that contain the old custom field may be affected and will need to be updated. This could potentially result in data loss if the rules are not updated correctly.
D is also correct because if there are any list views based on the old custom field, those list views will need to be modified or recreated with the new custom field. Failing to do so could result in data loss if users are unable to see the correct data in their list views.
A is incorrect because the use of a global value set does not guarantee that there will be no data loss. Any existing data stored in the old custom field will need to be mapped to the appropriate values in the new picklist field, and any automation or processes that reference the old custom field will need to be updated.
C is incorrect because auto updates to Visualforce references may prevent syntax errors, but they do not prevent data loss. Any existing data stored in the old custom field will need to be mapped to the appropriate values in the new picklist field.

The administrator at AW Consulting has created a custom picklist field. Business users have requested that it be a text field. The administrator attempts to change the field type but, is unable to because it is referenced by other functionalities. Which functionality is preventing the field type from being changed? 
*Formula fields
Record types
Visualforce
Javascript
Explanation: A is the correct answer because according to Salesforce's documentation, formula fields can reference picklist fields, which can prevent the picklist field from being changed to a text field. Formula fields are types of fields that calculate a value based on an expression or formula that references other fields or constants. Formula fields prevent administrators from changing their field type once they are created because they may be referenced by other functionalities such as reports, validation rules, workflow rules, etc., that depend on their data type and value. If a formula field is referenced by other functionalities, then changing its field type may cause errors or unexpected results. Record types, Visualforce, and Javascript do not have the ability to reference picklist fields in the same way formula fields do. Therefore, options B, C, and D are incorrect.

The standard Lead Rating field has picklist values of Hot, Warm, and Cold. A list of new leads was imported without errors even though several records had the value of Unrated in the Rating field. How were these records added without error? 
*The Restricted picklist checkbox was unchecked.
Field-level security was set to Visible for all profiles.
A global picklist value set was used to populate the picklist.
The Add to All Record Types checkbox was selected.
Explanation: According to Salesforce's documentation, when the "Restricted picklist" checkbox is checked for a picklist field, only the values defined in the picklist are allowed for that field. However, if the checkbox is unchecked, users can manually enter any value into the field, even if it is not defined in the picklist. Therefore, option A - "The Restricted picklist checkbox was unchecked" - is the correct answer as it allows users to add new values to the picklist without generating an error. Options B, C, and D are not relevant to the situation described in the question.

Ursa Major classifies its accounts as Silver, Gold, or Platinum Level. When a new case is created for a Silver or Gold partner, it should go to the Regular Support Queue. When an account is Platinum Level, it should automatically go to the Priority Support Queue. What should the administrator use to achieve this? 
*Assignment Rules
Case Rules
Workflow Rules
Escalation Rules
Explanation: A is the correct answer because Assignment Rules allow for the automatic assignment of cases to specific queues or users based on specified criteria such as account type (Silver, Gold, or Platinum in this case). Case Rules would allow for the automatic subdivision or categorization of cases but not necessarily for the assignment to specific queues. Workflow Rules automate standard internal procedures and processes. Escalation Rules automatically send notifications or take actions when certain conditions or timelines are met, but they do not address the specific issue of assigning cases to the appropriate queue based on account type.

Universal Containers wants to provide reseller partners with discounted prices on the products they purchase. How should an administrator configure this requirement? 
Add a Partner_Discount_c field to the Opportunity
Build separate reseller partner products.
Use a different Opportunity record type.
*Create a separate PriceBook for reseller partners.
Explanation: The correct answer is D.
Salesforce's documentation states that creating a separate PriceBook is the recommended approach for providing discounted prices to specific groups of customers. This allows for greater flexibility in managing pricing for different types of customers, such as reseller partners. Option A (adding a field to the Opportunity) and Option C (using a different Opportunity record type) do not address the issue of managing pricing specifically for reseller partners. Option B (building separate reseller partner products) may be too complex and time-consuming, and may not be necessary if the discount can be applied through a separate PriceBook. Therefore, D is the best option for configuring this requirement.

The Marketing team at Cloud Kicks uses campaigns to generate product interest. They want custom picklist values for the Campaign Member Status field for each campaign they run. Currently, they ask the administrator to add or delete values, but this is very time consuming. Which two user permission should allow the Marketing team to customize the campaign member status picklist values themselves? Choose 2 answers.  
Create and Edit for Campaign Member
*Marketing user feature license
Customize Application permission
*Edit permission for campaigns
Explanation: B,D: To customize the campaign member status picklist values themselves, marketing users need two things: a marketing user feature license and edit permission for campaigns. A marketing user feature license enables users to create, edit, and delete campaigns; manage campaign members; and update campaign history via the import wizards or API. Edit permission for campaigns allows users to modify existing campaigns and their related records such as campaign members and campaign member statuses. Reference:  https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.campaigns_customize_member_status_parent.htm&amp;type=5

The administrator at Universal Container has created two objects: Containers_c, Purchase_c. Management has requested that all container records display on purchase records in Salesforce. Which type of relationship between Containers_c and Purchase_c should satisfy the requirement? 
Roll-Up Summary field
Formula field
Master-detail field
*Lookup field
Explanation: The correct answer is D, Lookup field. 
This is because a Lookup relationship allows the Purchase object to reference the Container object. This means that for each Purchase record, there can be a related Container record. 
Option A, Roll-Up Summary field, is incorrect because it is used to summarize data from child records onto the parent record in a Master-Detail relationship.
Option B, Formula field, is incorrect because it is used to calculate values based on other fields on the same record.
Option C, Master-detail field, is also incorrect because it requires each Purchase record to have a corresponding Container record. In this case, Management has requested that all container records display on purchase records, which implies that not every Purchase record may have a corresponding Container record.

Cloud Kicks (CK) stores information about specific customers in Contacts and information about shoes and accessories in a custom Merchandise object. What should the CK administrator use to represent that Contact can be interested in multiple pieces of Merchandies? 
Hierarchy column
Lookup filter
Formula field
*Junction object
Explanation: The correct answer is D. Junction object.
A junction object is a custom object that is used to create a many-to-many relationship between two objects. In this scenario, a junction object can be used to represent that a Contact can be interested in multiple pieces of Merchandise. This can be done by creating a junction object that has a relationship with both the Contact and Merchandise objects. This allows the administrator to create a many-to-many relationship between these two objects, so that each Contact can be associated with multiple pieces of Merchandise and each piece of Merchandise can be associated with multiple Contacts.
The other answer options are incorrect:
A. Hierarchy column: Hierarchy columns are used to represent hierarchical relationships between records in a single object. This is not applicable to this scenario, as it involves a many-to-many relationship between two different objects.
B. Lookup filter: A lookup filter is used to filter the records that are available in a particular lookup field. This is not applicable to this scenario, as it does not address the need to create a many-to-many relationship between two objects.
C. Formula field: A formula field is used to calculate a value based on other fields in the same object. This is not applicable to this scenario, as it does not address the need to create a many-to-many relationship between two objects.

The administrator has created new users for ten new employees at Northern Trail Outfitters. Why are these users unable to access the account object in Salesforce? 
Users' profile requires a sharing rule for Accounts.
*Users' profile requires permission to the Account object.
Users' roles are low on the role hierarchy.
Organization-wide defaults are set to private.
Explanation: B is the correct answer because according to Salesforce's documentation, users must have permission to an object in order to view or modify it. If these users are unable to access the account object, it is likely because their profile does not have the necessary permissions. Option A is incorrect because sharing rules are used for sharing data that users already have access to. Option C is incorrect because roles would only come into play if sharing settings were set to something other than private. Option D is also incorrect because organization-wide defaults only apply when sharing settings are set to private or public read-only.

Universal Containers created a new job posting on the first of the month. It triggered and a process scheduled action would send a Chatter post to the department VP in 30 days if the position was still open and the status was NOT equal to Interviewing. On the 10th of the month, the application interview, and the job posting status is updated to Interviewing. What will happen to the Chatter post in this situation?  
*The pending Chatter post will be canceled.
The pending Chatter post will be sent on the 10th of the month
The pending Chatter post will be will be paused.
The pending Chatter post will be sent in 30 days.
Explanation: A is the correct answer because the status of the job posting has been updated to Interviewing, which means it is now equal to Interviewing. Therefore, the condition for the scheduled action to send the Chatter post (status is NOT equal to Interviewing) is no longer met, and the pending Chatter post will be canceled. Option B is incorrect because the status has been updated to Interviewing, so the scheduled action will not send the Chatter post. Option C is incorrect because there is no mention of a pause action being implemented in the process. Option D is incorrect because the condition for sending the Chatter post is no longer met.

Support reps at Cloud Kicks (CK) are reporting that when they try to close a case, the Closed option in the Case Status picklist is missing. CK has asked the administrator to find a solution. Why are the support reps unable to see the Closed option in the specified picklist? 
The Case record type is missing Closed as a picklist value.
The Close Case page layout must be used to close a case.
The Show Closed Statuses in Case Status Field checkbox is set to the default.
*The Support Process being used omits Closed as a status choice.
Explanation: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000380709&amp;type=1 

Sales managers would like to know what could be implemented to surface important values based on the stage of the opportunity. Which tool should an administrator use to meet this requirement? 
Opportunity Processes
Dynamic Forms
*Path Key fields
Workflow Rules
Explanation: The correct answer is C, Path Key fields. Salesforce's documentation explains that Path is a feature that provides guidance to sales and service reps on the best process to follow for a given job or process. It includes key fields that are associated with each stage of the process, which helps sales managers surface important values based on the stage of the opportunity. Opportunity Processes (A) are used to automate the steps and work that occur with an opportunity. Dynamic Forms (B) allow for more flexible and customized form layouts. Workflow Rules (D) allow for automated actions based on specified criteria. While these tools may be useful for other purposes, they do not specifically meet the requirement for surfacing important values based on the stage of the opportunity, which is the focus of the question.

AW Computing has added a new custom text field called Market Segment on the Lead object. When a Lead is converted, the new field is not getting copied to the Account record. What should the administrator do to ensure the Market Segment field from a Lead is copied to the converted Account record in routine? 
*Ensure the Market Segment field on the Lead is mapped to right field on Account.
Ensure Account has a field that has the exact same name as the new Lead field.
Write a Validation Rule to ensure the Account has a value in that field.
Write a record-triggered flow to copy the custom field from Lead to Account.
Explanation: A is the correct answer because it suggests that the Market Segment field on the Lead needs to be mapped to the corresponding field on the Account, which is necessary for the data to be transferred during conversion. To ensure that the custom text field "market segment" from a lead is copied to the converted account record, the administrator should follow these steps:
   1. Go to Setup and click on Object Manager.
  2. Select the Lead object and click on Fields &amp; Relationships.
   3. Click on the "Map Lead Fields" button.
  4.  Scroll down to the "Account" section and locate the "Market Segment" field.
   5. Map the "Market Segment" field from the Lead object to the corresponding field on the Account object.
  6. Save the mapping and test the conversion process to confirm that the Market Segment field is now getting copied to the converted Account record.
By mapping the custom field during the lead conversion process, the administrator can ensure that the data is transferred from the lead record to the corresponding account record.
B is incorrect because having a field with the exact same name on the Account does not ensure that the data from the Lead will be copied over during conversion.
C is incorrect because writing a Validation Rule will only ensure that the Account has a value in the field, but it does not address the issue of copying the data from the Lead to the Account during conversion.
D is incorrect because writing a record-triggered flow is unnecessary when mapping the fields during conversion can accomplish the same result.

Cloud Kicks is Introducing a new shoe model and wants to advertise on TV, radio, print, and social under the banner of a brand called New Runners. In addition, total statistics for this marketing effort need to be aggregated and visible. Which feature should the administrator use to implement this functionality? 
Junction object
*Parent campaign field
Lookup relationship
Master-detail relationship
Explanation: B is the correct answer because the parent campaign field is used to track and group together related campaigns, which is exactly what is needed for Cloud Kicks' marketing efforts under the New Runners brand. This will allow for easy aggregation of statistics and visibility of the overall effectiveness of the marketing campaign. 
A junction object is used to create many-to-many relationships between two objects, which is not necessary for this scenario. 
A lookup relationship is used to relate two objects together with a foreign key, but it does not provide the same level of grouping and tracking as the parent campaign field. 
A master-detail relationship is used to establish a special type of relationship where the detail record belongs to a specific master record, which is not necessary for this scenario.

The IT manager at universal Containers is doing an audit of the systems security. How should the administrator provide a summary of the org's security health? 
Change the Organization-Wide Default to private to restrict visibility.
Turn on Event Monitoring to track user events.
Download the last six months of user login data.
*Run a Health Check to identify vulnerabilities.
Explanation: According to Salesforce's documentation, running a Health Check is the correct way to provide a summary of an org's security health. Health Check is a tool that analyzes multiple aspects of an org's configuration, including security settings, to identify potential vulnerabilities and inefficiencies. Option A is incorrect because changing the Organization-Wide Default to private does not provide a summary of the org's security health but restricts visibility. Option B is incorrect because Event Monitoring only tracks user events but does not provide a comprehensive summary of the org's security health. Option C is incorrect because downloading user login data only shows user activity but does not provide a comprehensive summary of the org's security health.

Ursa Major Solar provides a 1-year warranty on all of the panels it installs. Installation details, along with the warranty information, is captured on a custom object called Installation. The installation record is created by the installer from the mobile app. Customers receive a longer warranty as a way of increasing customer satisfaction when an installation gets delayed or has issues. How should the administrator configure Salesforce to capture the expiration date of the warranty? 
*Use a formula as the default value of the warranty Expiration Date field.
Create a formula field to display 1 year from the warranty purchased.
Add a validation rule to ensure the Expiration Date field is populated.
Include the warranty Expiration Date field on the mobile page layout.
Explanation: A is the correct answer because using a formula as the default value of the warranty Expiration Date field ensures that the expiration date is automatically calculated based on the date the Installation record is created and the length of the warranty (1 year). This simplifies data entry for the installer and reduces the chance of human error. 
B is incorrect because it only displays the expiration date of the warranty, but does not capture it in a field for reporting or automation purposes. 
C is also incorrect because it only enforces data entry but does not address how to capture the expiration date. 
D is also incorrect because including the warranty Expiration Date field on the mobile page layout does not specify how to populate or calculate the value of the field.

A Sales user is trying to manage Campaign Members for an upcoming networking event. The user can view the Campaign, but cannot add new Campaign Members or update Member statuses. How can an administrator troubleshoot this problem? 
Create a permission set to allow the user to edit Campaign Members.
Provide the user access to both Leads and Contacts to edit all Members.
*Make sure the Marketing User Checkbox is checked on the user record page.
Run a Campaign report and update any Member information via Data Loader.
Explanation: C is the correct answer because according to Salesforce documentation, the Marketing User Checkbox controls whether a user can create, update, or delete Campaign Members. By making sure that the Marketing User Checkbox is checked on the user record page, the Sales user will have the necessary permissions to add new Campaign Members and update Member statuses.
A is incorrect because creating a permission set to allow the user to edit Campaign Members might not address the root cause of the issue, which is the missing Marketing User Checkbox permission.
B is incorrect because providing access to both Leads and Contacts does not necessarily grant the user the necessary permissions to edit Campaign Members. The user might still be restricted if the Marketing User Checkbox is not checked.
D is incorrect because running a Campaign report and updating Member information via Data Loader does not address the issue of permissions. It might be a workaround for updating the information, but it does not troubleshoot the problem with the user's inability to add new Campaign Members or update Member statuses. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.campaigns_members_using.htm&amp;type=5 

A user at Northern Trail Outfitters Is having trouble logging into Salesforce. The user's login history shows that this person has attempted to log in multiple times and has been locked out of the organization. Which two ways should the administrator help the user log into Salesforce? 
Log in as the user to unlock the user and reset the password.
Reset the password policies to allow the user to login.
*Reset password on the user's record detail page.
*Use the unlock button on the user's record detail page.
Explanation: The correct answers are C and D because they directly address the issue of the user being locked out of the organization due to multiple login attempts - https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/programming/9781849685986/2/ch02lvl1sec28/locking-and-unlocking-users. Option A is incorrect as it is not recommended for an administrator to log in as a user unless absolutely necessary. Option B is also incorrect as resetting password policies won't necessarily help the user log in if they are already locked out.

The administrator for AW Computing is working with a user who is having trouble logging in to Salesforce. What should the administrator do to identify why the user Is unable to log in? 
*Review the login history for the user.
Check the attempted logins by running the setup audit trail.
Pull the password history to ensure the password policy was followed.
Reset the security token for the profile.
Explanation: A is the correct answer because reviewing the login history for the user can help identify any login attempts and errors. This can provide valuable information such as whether the user is using the correct username and password or if there are any IP restrictions or login restrictions in place. 
B is incorrect as it is not directly related to the login issues of the user. The setup audit trail tracks changes made to the Salesforce setup, not user login attempts.
C is incorrect as checking the password history is not likely to provide any useful information about why the user is not able to log in.
D is also incorrect as resetting the security token for the profile would not help resolve any login issues for the user.

Which setting on a profile makes a tab hidden in the All App Launcher or viable in the app, but still allows a user to view records that would normally be found under this tab? Choose 1. 
Object Permissions
App Permissions
Page wide Defaults
*Tab Settings
Explanation: The correct answer is D, Tab Settings. According to Salesforce's documentation, Tab Settings on a profile can hide a tab in the All App Launcher or make it visible in a certain app, but still allow the user to view records found under that tab. Object Permissions control access to specific objects and their fields, App Permissions control access to entire apps, and Picklist Defaults control default values for picklists. These settings do not affect the visibility of tabs in the App Launcher.

An administrator is planning to use Data Loader to mass import new records to a custom object from a new API. What will the administrator need to do to use the Data Loader? 
Add a permission set that allows them to import data.
*Append their security token at the end of their password to login.
Use the Data Import Tool to mass import custom object records.
Reset their password and their security token.
Explanation: B. To use Data Loader to mass import new records to a custom object from a new API, the administrator will need to append their security token at the end of their password to login. The security token is an alphanumeric code that is required for API access when logging in from an IP address that is not trusted by Salesforce. The security token can be obtained from the user's personal settings or by resetting it via email. Adding a permission set, resetting the password and the security token, or using the Data Import Tool are not necessary for using Data Loader.

An administrator at Northern Trail Outfitters is creating a validation rule. Which two functions should the administrator use when creating a validation rule? Choose 2 answers.  
Formula return type
*Error condition formula
*Error message location
Rule active date
Explanation: According to Salesforce documentation, when creating a validation rule, the administrator should use the 'Error condition formula' and 'Error message location' functions. 
The 'Error condition formula' function allows the admin to set the condition that triggers the validation rule, determining when an error message should display. 
The 'Error message location' function specifies where the error message will appear when the validation rule is triggered (e.g., on the record page, in a pop-up window, etc.).
Option A, 'Formula return type', is not a relevant function when creating a validation rule. 
Option D, 'Rule active date', is also not a function when creating a validation rule. Although an administrator can set a validation rule to be active on a specific date, this is not a function of the validation rule itself. https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/point_click_business_logic/validation_rules 

An administrator at Universal Containers has been asked to prevent users from accessing Salesforce from outside of their network. What are two considerations for this configuration? Choose 2 answers.  
*IP address restrictions are set on the profile or globally for the org.
Assign single sign-on to a permission set to allow users to log in when outside the network.
*'Enforce Login IP Ranges on Every Request' must be selected to enforce IP restrictions.
Restrict U2F Security Keys on the user's profile to enforce login hours.
Explanation: A is correct because IP address restrictions would be the most effective way to prevent users from accessing Salesforce from outside of their network. By setting IP address restrictions on the profile or globally for the org, the administrator can ensure that only users accessing Salesforce from within the company's network are able to log in.
C is correct because Enforce Login IP Ranges on Every Request must be selected to enforce IP restrictions. This setting ensures that users can only access Salesforce from specific IP addresses or ranges of IP addresses. This is important for preventing unauthorized access to Salesforce from outside of the company's network.
B and D are incorrect because single sign-on and U2F Security Keys do not directly address the issue of preventing users from accessing Salesforce from outside of their network. Single sign-on allows users to log in to Salesforce with a single set of credentials, but does not restrict access based on IP address. U2F Security Keys can enhance security by requiring physical authentication, but also do not restrict access to specific IP addresses.

The administrator at Northern Trail Outfitters is unable to add a new user in Salesforce. What could cause this issue? 
*The username is already in use in another organization.
The username is restricted to a domain specific to my domain.
The email address used for the username has a contact record.
The email used for the username is not a corporate email address.
Explanation: A is the correct answer because it is the only option that directly addresses the inability to add a new user. If the username is already in use by another organization, then Northern Trail Outfitters would not be able to use that username to add a new user.  https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.adding_new_users.htm&amp;type=5 
B, C, and D could potentially cause issues with adding a new user, but they do not directly address the specific problem stated in the question. B discusses domain restrictions, which could cause issues but is not directly related to adding a new user. C discusses email addresses having contact records, which could also cause issues but again is not directly related to adding a new user. D discusses the email address not being a corporate email, which could potentially cause issues with certain security settings, but it does not directly address the issue of being unable to add a new user.

Ursa Major Solar has a path on Case. The company wants to require its users to follow the status values as they are on the path. Agents should be prohibited from reverting the Case back to a previous status. Which feature should an administrator use to fulfill this request? 
Predefined Field Values
Global Value Picklists
Dependent Picklists
*Validation Rules
Explanation: D is the correct answer because validation rules can be used to enforce business logic and data quality requirements. In this scenario, a validation rule can be created to prevent agents from selecting a previous status value on the Case path. A is incorrect because predefined field values only allow for certain values to be selected, but do not prevent selection of previous values. B is incorrect because global value picklists only standardize values across an org, but do not prevent selection of previous values. C is incorrect because dependent picklists allow for values to be filtered based on a previous selection, but do not prevent selection of previous values.

Northern Trail Outfitters has hired interns to enter Leads Into Salesforce and has requested a way to identify these new records from existing Leads. What approach should an administrator take to meet this requirement? 
Create a separate Lead Lightning App.
*Define a record type and assign it to the interns.
Set up Web-to-Lead for the interns' use.
Update the active Lead Assignment Rules.
Explanation: The correct answer is B. Salesforce documentation recommends defining a record type to distinguish between new records created by interns and existing Leads. This approach allows the administrator to assign specific page layouts, picklists, record types, and other attributes to the newly created Leads for ease of identification. Option A, creating a separate Lead Lightning App, is not necessary as record types can achieve the same outcome. Option C, setting up Web-to-Lead, is not relevant to this scenario as the Leads are being entered by interns, not captured through a web form. Option D, updating the active Lead Assignment Rules, is also unrelated to the requirement of identifying new records created by interns.

Sales reps at Ursa Major Solar are having difficulty managing deals. The leadership team has asked administrator to help sales reps prioritize and close more deals. What can the administrator configure to help with these issues? 
Einstein Activity Capture
*Einstein Opportunity Scoring
Einstein Search Personalization 
Einstein Lead Scoring
Explanation: B is the correct answer because Einstein Opportunity Scoring analyzes different attributes of a deal and provides a score for each opportunity based on how likely it is to close. This allows sales reps to prioritize their efforts and focus on the deals that are most likely to close. A is incorrect because Einstein Activity Capture mainly focuses on tracking and logging a user's activities, rather than helping manage deals. C is incorrect because Einstein Search Personalization is focused on improving search results for users, and is not related to managing deals. D is incorrect because Einstein Lead Scoring is focused on analyzing leads and determining which ones are most likely to become a customer, rather than helping manage deals that are already in progress.

Cloud Kicks wants to track shoe designs by products. Shoe designs should be unable to be deleted, and there can be multiple designs for one product across various stages. Which two steps should the administrator configure to meet this requirement? Choose 2 answers.  
Add a custom master-detail field for shoe designs on the Product object.
*Create a custom object for shoe designs.
Use the standard object for designs.
*Configure a custom lookup field for shoe designs on the Product object.
Explanation: Based on Salesforce's documentation, B and D are the correct answers because they fulfill the given requirements.B. Creating a custom object for shoe designs allows the administrator to have a dedicated object where they can track and manage the shoe designs. This custom object can have its own set of fields, relationships, and functionalities specific to shoe designs, such as different stages or attributes related to designs. This ensures that shoe designs can be tracked independently and cannot be deleted unintentionally.D. Configuring a custom lookup field for shoe designs on the Product object allows for a relationship between the shoe designs and the products. This enables the administrator to associate multiple shoe designs with a single product. The lookup field creates a reference between the two objects, allowing for easy access and visibility of the related shoe designs on the Product object's record page.

Ursa Major Solar has service level agreements (SLA) that are routed to support queues. Cases that meet the 24 hour SLA need to be automatically re-assigned to the next tier queue. Which feature should be used to fulfill this requirement? 
Einstein Case Routing
Auto-response rule
Case assignment rule
*Case escalation rule
Explanation: The correct answer is D, Case escalation rule. This is because case escalation rules allow for cases that have not been resolved within a specified time frame to be escalated to the appropriate person or team. In this case, if a case meets the 24 hour SLA and has not been resolved, the escalation rule can automatically re-assign the case to the next tier queue. A, Einstein Case Routing, is not the correct answer because it uses artificial intelligence to route cases to the best agent based on skill, availability, and workload, but it does not have the capability to automatically re-assign cases based on SLAs. B, Auto-response rule, is not the correct answer because it automatically sends a response to the customer to acknowledge their inquiry or issue, but it does not involve case re-assignment. C, Case assignment rule, is not the correct answer because it simply assigns cases to a specific user or queue based on criteria such as case origin or product type, but it does not involve automatic re-assignment based on SLAs.

Northern Trail Outfitters (NTO) has deployed my domain. The Chief Marketing Officer wants to make sure that all of the Salesforce users log in using the branded login URL. There needs to be a grace period for the user's bookmarks to be updated. How should the administrator configure the policies in my domain settings? 
Set the login policy to require login from https://nto.my.salesforce.com
Set the Redirect policy to Do Not redirect.
*Set the redirect policy to Redirect with a warning to the same page within the domain.
Set the login policy to prevent login from https://login.salesforce.com
Explanation: To configure the policies in my domain settings for Northern Trail Outfitters (NTO) to ensure that Salesforce users log in using the branded login URL and provide a grace period for users to update their bookmarks, the administrator should:
C. Set the redirect policy to Redirect with a warning to the same page within the domain.
By setting the redirect policy to "Redirect with a warning to the same page within the domain," users accessing the Salesforce login page via the default URL (e.g., https://login.salesforce.com) will be redirected to the branded login URL (e.g., https://nto.my.salesforce.com) with a warning message. This allows users to update their bookmarks gradually while still being able to access the Salesforce login page. It provides a grace period during which users can adapt to the new branded login URL.
Therefore, the correct option is C. Set the redirect policy to Redirect with a warning to the same page within the domain.

Universal Containers introduced a new product and wants to track all associated cases that get logged. They are looking for an automated solution that would give the product's two lead engineers read/write access to all new cases that reference the new product. What should an administrator do to satisfy this requirement? 
*Create a queue and a criteria-based sharing rule.
Create a predefined case team and an assignment rule.
Create a user-based sharing rule and an ad-hoc case team.
Create an auto-response rule and a public group.
Explanation: The correct answer is A. Create a queue and a criteria-based sharing rule.
This solution satisfies the requirement because it allows the product's two lead engineers to have read/write access to all new cases that reference the new product. To track all cases that reference the new product and give read/write access to the product’s two
lead engineers, the administrator should create a queue and a criteria-based sharing rule. The queue
will allow assigning cases that meet certain criteria, such as having a specific value in the Product
field, to a group of users. The criteria-based sharing rule will grant read/write access to the queue
members for cases that match the same criteria.
Option B, creating a predefined case team and an assignment rule, would only allow specific users to be assigned to the cases, but it does not specify read/write access for the lead engineers.
Option C, creating a user-based sharing rule and an ad-hoc case team, would allow specific users to have access to the cases, but it does not specify read/write access for the lead engineers.
Option D, creating an auto-response rule and a public group, would only automate the response to the cases and does not specify read/write access for the lead engineers.

Universal Containers has three separate lines of business. Each line has specific fields that must be displayed to users. However, the fields needed by the sales team are different than the fields needed by the service team. How should the administrator configure this requirement? 
Create two record types, each with 3 page layouts.
Create one record type with six Page Layouts.
*Create three record types, each with 2 page layouts.
Create six record types, each with 1 page layout.
Explanation: The correct answer is C: Create three record types, each with 2 page layouts.
Salesforce's documentation states that the best practice is to create one record type for each distinct business process. In this case, Universal Containers has three separate lines of business, so it makes sense to create three record types to cater to each line of business.
Each record type should have two page layouts: one for the sales team and one for the service team. This ensures that the fields needed by each team are displayed appropriately.
Option A is incorrect because it only creates two record types, which may not cater to all three lines of business. Additionally, having three page layouts for each record type may become cluttered and difficult to manage.
Option B is incorrect because having six page layouts in one record type may become cluttered and difficult to manage. It's also not ideal to have fields specific to one line of business mixed in with fields specific to another line of business.
Option D is incorrect because having six record types with only one page layout each may not cater to all lines of business, and it may also become cluttered and difficult to manage.

Which two objects are customizable in the Stage Setup Flow? Choose 2 answers.  
*Leads
Campaigns
*Opportunities
Campaign Members
Explanation: A and C are the correct answers because Stage Setup Flow is used to customize the sales process, specifically defining the stages and the picklist values that are available for each stage. Leads and Opportunities are standard objects in Salesforce that have stages, and these stages can be customized with the Stage Setup Flow. Campaigns and Campaign Members do not have stages and are not customizable with the Stage Setup Flow.

The Sales manager at DreamHouse Realty wants the sales users to have a quick way to view and edit the Opportunities in their pipeline expected to close in the next 90 days. What should an administrator do to accomplish this request? 
Create a custom report and schedule the sales users to receive it each day as a reminder to update their opportunities.
Enable Sales Console and show users how to open a tab for each opportunity in the pipeline that meets the requirements.
*Create a list view on the Opportunity object and recommend users switch the view to Kanban to edit by drag and drop.
Make a new Sales dashboard and add a component that shows all opportunities that meet the criteria.
Explanation: C is the correct answer because creating a list view on the Opportunity object and recommending users switch the view to Kanban allows for a quick way to view and edit the Opportunities in their pipeline expected to close in the next 90 days. This option allows users to visually see their pipeline and easily move opportunities from one stage to another by drag and drop.  
A is incorrect because while it does provide a reminder for sales users to update their opportunities, it does not provide a quick and efficient way to view and edit opportunities in their pipeline. 
B is incorrect because enabling Sales Console and opening a tab for each opportunity in the pipeline that meets the requirements would be time-consuming and not a quick way to view and edit opportunities in their pipeline. 
D is incorrect because while it does create a dashboard component to show opportunities that meet the criteria, it does not provide a quick and efficient way to edit and manage opportunities in their pipeline.

An administrator at AW Computing has been asked to help the Support team with report folders. They want a folder called Support Reports and two folders underneath called Helpdesk and R&amp;D. The Support organization uses public groups for Support Agents, R&amp;D, and Managers. Support agents should be able to run Helpdesk reports, but should not be able to view R&amp;D reports. Support managers should be able to view and edit all reports. Which two ways should these folders be shared? Choose 2 answers.  
Share the R&amp;D folder with Support Managers with Edit Access.
*Share the Helpdesk folder with Support Agents with View access.
*Share the Support Reports folder with Support Managers with Edit Access.
Share the Support Reports folder with Support Agents with View Access.
Explanation: B and C are the correct answers because they align with the requirements of the scenario. Option B ensures that Support Agents are able to run Helpdesk reports, while not being able to view R&amp;D reports. Option C allows Support Managers to view and edit all reports. 
Option A is incorrect because it only shares the R&amp;D folder with Support Managers and does not provide any access for Support Agents who need to run Helpdesk reports. 
Option D is incorrect because it only shares the Support Reports folder with Support Agents, without differentiating between the Helpdesk and R&amp;D folders, and does not provide any access for Support Managers who need to view and edit all reports.

Northern Trail Outfitters wants to encourage employees to choose secure and appropriate passwords for their Salesforce accounts. Which three password policies should an administrator configure? Choose 3 answers.  
*Maximum invalid login attempts
Prohibited password values
Require use of Password Manager App
*Password complexity requirements
*Number of days until expiration
Explanation: A, D, and E are the correct answers because they all relate to enforcing and encouraging secure passwords. 
Maximum invalid login attempts helps to prevent brute force attacks on an account, Password complexity requirements ensure that users create strong and unique passwords, and Number of days until expiration ensures that users change their passwords periodically and don't keep the same password for too long. 
Prohibited password values could be useful in preventing users from choosing obvious or easy-to-guess passwords, but it is less critical than the other policies. 
Require use of Password Manager App may be helpful in encouraging users to use unique passwords, but it is not a direct password policy itself.

At Universal Containers, there is a custom field on the Lead named Product Category. Management wants this information to be part of the Opportunity upon lead conversion. What action should the administrator take to satisfy the request? 
Map the lead custom field to the product's product category field.
Create a workflow to update Opportunity fields based on the lead.
*Create a custom field on the Opportunity and map the two fields.
Configure the product categories picklist field on the product.
Explanation: C is the correct answer because the question is asking how the custom field on the Lead named Product Category can be included in the Opportunity upon lead conversion. The best way to do this is to create a custom field on the Opportunity object and map it to the custom field on the Lead object. Option A is incorrect because it suggests mapping the lead custom field to the product's product category field, which is not relevant to the question. Option B is also incorrect because a workflow cannot create a new custom field on the Opportunity object. Option D is incorrect because it addresses the product categories picklist field, which is not the same as the custom field on the Lead object.

DreamHouse Reality needs to use consistent picklist value on a category field on accounts and cases, with value respective to record types. Which two features should the administrator use to fulfill this requirement? Choose 2 answers.  
*Dependent Picklist
Global Picklist
Multi-Select Picklist
*Custom Picklist
Explanation: A and D are the correct answers for this question because they are the features that Salesforce recommends for meeting the specified requirement.
A. Dependent Picklist: This feature allows you to create a relationship between two picklist fields, where the values available in the dependent picklist depend on the value selected in the controlling picklist field. In this case, if the category field on accounts and cases needs to have consistent values based on record types, using dependent picklists can ensure that the available picklist values are relevant to the selected record type.
D. Custom Picklist: This feature allows you to create a custom picklist field with predefined values. By creating a custom picklist field for the category field on accounts and cases, you can ensure that the values are consistent across the different record types.
B. Global Picklist: This feature allows you to create a picklist field that can be used across multiple objects. While it is useful for maintaining consistency across objects, it does not directly address the requirement of having values respective to record types.
C. Multi-Select Picklist: This feature allows you to select multiple values from a list. However, it does not ensure consistency or specific values respective to record types, so it is not the best fit for this requirement.

The Administrator at Cloud Kicks need to automatically route support cases, regardless of how they are created, to a queue based on case priority. What tool should the administrator use? 
Email-to-Case
*Assignment Rules
Auto-Response Rules
Web-to-case
Explanation: B is the correct answer because Assignment Rules is a Salesforce feature that allows automated case routing based on specific criteria, such as priority. This tool can route cases created from any source (email, web, phone, etc.) to a designated queue based on the priority level set in the rule. 
Option A, Email-to-Case, is a tool that converts customer emails into cases in Salesforce, but it does not have the ability to route cases based on priority.
Option C, Auto-Response Rules, is a tool that sends automated responses to customers when they submit a case, but it does not have the ability to route cases based on priority.
Option D, Web-to-case, is a tool that allows customers to submit cases directly from a company's website, but it does not have the ability to route cases based on priority.

An Administrator supporting global team of salesforce users has been asked to configure the company settings. Which two options should the administrator configure? Choose 2 answers.  
Login Hours
Password Policy
*Default Language
*Currency Local
Explanation: C and D are the correct answers because:
A. Login Hours can be configured for individual users by their own Salesforce administrator, but it is not a setting that applies to the entire company.
B. Password Policy can also be set by individual administrators and is not a setting that applies to the entire company.
C. Default Language is an important setting for a global team to ensure clear communication across borders and is therefore an essential configuration for an Administrator supporting a global team of Salesforce users.
D. Currency Locale needs to be set correctly if using multiple currencies in Salesforce for accurate financial reporting. Therefore, it is also an important configuration for an Administrator supporting a global team of Salesforce users.

The Administrator at Universal Container wants to add branding to salesforce. Which two considerations should the administrator keep in mind? Choose 2 answers.  
*Only one theme can be active at a time, and a theme applies to the entire org.
Themes apply to salesforce classic and to the salesforce mobile app.
Up to 300 custom themes can be created, modified, or cloned from the built-in themes.
*Chatter external users see the built-in Lightning theme only.
Explanation: Option A is correct because it states that only one theme can be active at a time and a theme applies to the entire organization. This is important for the administrator to keep in mind as they plan to add branding to Salesforce. They need to ensure they choose the right theme that will be applied to all users and throughout the entire organization.
Option D is correct because it states that Chatter external users will see the built-in Lightning theme only. This is important for the administrator to consider as they plan to add branding. They need to be aware that external users will have a specific theme applied to their Chatter experience, and they may need to adjust their branding accordingly. 
Option B is incorrect because it states that themes apply to Salesforce Classic and the Salesforce mobile app. This is not a consideration for the administrator as they are only looking to add branding and not concerned with the compatibility of themes across different platforms. 
Option C is incorrect because it states that up to 300 custom themes can be created, modified, or cloned from the built-in themes. The number of custom themes that can be created is not a relevant consideration for the administrator when adding branding to Salesforce. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.brand_your_org_in_lightning_experience.htm&amp;type=5 

AW Computing would like to improve its Case Lightning record page by including: A filtered component to display a message in bold font when a case is saved as a critical record type, a quick way to update the account status from the case layout. Which two components should an administrator use to satisfy these requests? Choose 2 answers.  
Related List
*Related Record
Record details
*Rich text
Explanation: According to Salesforce's documentation, B and D are the correct answers for this question.
B) Related Record component allows displaying related records on a Lightning record page. In this case, it can be used to display a related message in bold font when a case is saved as a critical record type. By configuring the Related Record component, the administrator can select the appropriate fields to display and customize the formatting of the message.
D) Rich Text component allows adding rich text content to a Lightning record page. In this case, it can be used to display a filtered message in bold font when a case is saved as a critical record type. The administrator can customize the formatting, such as bold font, and use conditional logic to filter the message to only display when the case is of a critical record type.
A) Related List component is not the correct option because it is used to display related lists of records, not specific custom messages or filtered content as requested in the question.
C) Record Details component is not the correct option because it is used to display the details of a single record, such as the record's fields and related lists, but it does not provide the flexibility to display custom messages or filtered content.
Based on Salesforce's documentation, B and D are the components that can be used by an administrator to satisfy the given requests.

Cloud Kicks has a screen flow with two questions on the same screen, but only one is necessary at a time. The administrator has been asked to show only the questions that are needed. How should an administrator complete this? 
Use a new version of the flow for each scenario.
Use a decision element and a new screen to show the proper question
*Use a conditional visibility to hide the unnecessary question
Use branching in the flow screen to show the proper scenario
Explanation: The correct answer is C. 
Salesforce documentation states that conditional visibility can be used to selectively hide or show components based on criteria. In this scenario, the administrator can use conditional visibility to hide the unnecessary question so that only the relevant question is shown. 
Option A is incorrect because creating a new version of the flow for each scenario would be time-consuming and could lead to confusion or errors. 
Option B is incorrect because while a decision element and a new screen could be used to show the proper question, it would require additional steps and would not be as efficient as using conditional visibility. 
Option D is also incorrect because branching in the flow screen would only allow the administrator to show the proper scenario, but it would not hide the unnecessary question.

Ursa Major Solar is noticing a decrease in deals with a cross-sell opportunity type and wants to share all cross-sell opportunities with a team of subject matter experts in their organisation. The company has different roles, and the organisation wide default opportunity is set to private. How should the administrator accomplish this? 
*Add the subject matter experts to a public group and give them access to records with a criteria-based sharing rule.
Change the organisation-wide default for opportunity from private to public Read/Write to open up access for subject matter experts.
Enable territory management, assign the subject matter experts to the same territory, and give them access to the records with manual sharing.
Create a new role for the subject matter experts and give them access to the records with the owner-based sharing rule
Explanation: A is the correct answer because it provides a solution that allows the subject matter experts access to the cross-sell opportunities without compromising the private settings of the organization-wide default opportunity. By adding the subject matter experts to a public group and creating a criteria-based sharing rule, they will be granted access to view the specific cross-sell opportunities they need. Changing the organization-wide default for opportunity from private to public (option B) would not be recommended if the organization has sensitive information that should remain private. Enabling territory management and assigning subject matter experts to the same territory (option C) would not be the best solution for this scenario. Finally, creating a new role for the subject matter experts and giving them access to the records with the owner-based sharing rule (option D) is not recommended since the sharing rule would be based on the owner (sales representative) rather than the cross-sell opportunity criteria.

Universal Container wants to prevent its service team from accessing deal records. While service users are unable to access deal list views, they are able to find the deal records via a search. What options should the administrator adjust to fully restrict access? 
Record setting and search index
*Permissions and tab visibility
App permissions and search terms
Page layouts and field- level security
Explanation: The correct answer is B) Permissions and tab visibility.
In this scenario, Universal Container wants to prevent its service team from accessing deal records. The problem mentioned is that service users are unable to access deal list views, but they can still find the deal records via a search.
To fully restrict access to deal records, the administrator should adjust permissions and tab visibility. By modifying permissions, the administrator can remove the service team's access to deal records altogether. This will prevent them from opening or viewing the records.
Additionally, adjusting tab visibility is important as it controls the visibility of specific tabs for different user profiles. By removing the deal tab from the service team's profile, they will no longer be able to see or search for deal records.
The other options are incorrect because:
A) Record setting and search index: Adjusting record settings and search indexes does not directly deal with restricting access to specific records. It is more focused on the functionality and setup of record searches and indexing.
C) App permissions and search terms: App permissions control access to different applications and features within Salesforce, but they are not directly related to restricting access to specific records. Similarly, search terms do not restrict access to records but rather help in finding specific records through search queries.
D) Page layouts and field-level security: Although changing page layouts and field-level security settings can control the visibility and accessibility of fields on a record page, they do not fully restrict access to deal records. They provide more granular control over specific fields rather than restricting access to entire records.

The Call centre manager in Ursa Major Solar wants to provide agents with a case dashboard that can be drilled down by case origin, status and owner. What should an Administrator add to the dashboard to fulfil the request? 
*Dashboard Filter
Bucket column
Dashboard component
Combination Chart
Explanation: The correct answer is A. Dashboard Filter. According to Salesforce's documentation on dashboards, a dashboard filter can be added to a dashboard to allow users to filter the data by different criteria such as case origin, status, and owner. This would enable agents to drill down and view specific cases based on their preferences. Bucket column does not apply here because it is used for grouping data into categories. Dashboard component and Combination Chart do not provide the specific filtering capabilities required for this scenario.

DreamHouse Realty (DHR) wants a templated process with a mortgage calculator that generates leads for loans. DHR needs to complete the project within 30 days and has maxed out its budget for the year. Which AppExchange item should help the administrator to meet the request? 
Lightning Data
Lightning Community
*Flow Solutions
Bolt Solutions
Explanation: C is the correct answer because Flow Solutions on the AppExchange provides pre-built templates for various business processes, including a mortgage calculator that can generate leads for loans. These templates can be quickly customized to fit DHR's specific needs, allowing them to complete the project within 30 days. Lightning Data and Lightning Community are not relevant to DHR's specific request, and Bolt Solutions' may not have a pre-built solution for DHR's needs.

Aw computing wants to prevent user from updating the Account Annual Revenue field to be a negative value or an amount more than $100 billion. How should an administrator accomplish this request? 
*Create a validation rule that displays an error if Account revenue is below 0 or greater than 100 billion.
Build a scheduled report displaying Account with Account revenue that is negative or greater than 100 billion.
Make the Account Revenue field required on the page layout.
Enable the Account Revenue limits in setup, with 0 as minimum and 100 billion as maximum
Explanation: A is the correct answer because it suggests creating a validation rule. A validation rule allows an administrator to ensure that data entered into Salesforce meets specific criteria, such as preventing negative or excessively high values from being entered into a field. The other options are incorrect because they do not address the request to prevent negative or excessively high values in the Account Annual Revenue field. Option B suggests building a scheduled report, which would not prevent users from entering incorrect values. Option C suggests making the field required, which also would not prevent incorrect values. Option D suggests enabling limits in setup, but it does not specify how to prevent incorrect values.

The administrator has been asked to automate a simple field update on the account. When a support agent changes the status of the account to 'Audited', they would like the system to automatically update the Audited date field on the account with today's date. Which tool should the administrator use to complete this automation? 
Approval process
Formula Field
*Flow Builder
Validation Rule
Explanation: The correct answer is C, Flow Builder, because this tool allows the administrator to create a simple automation that updates a field based on a specific condition, in this case, changing the status of the account to 'Audited'. Approval processes are used for approval workflows, Formula Fields calculate values based on other fields, and Validation Rules prevent users from saving incorrect data, but none of these options allow the administrator to create an automation that updates a field based on a specific condition. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.flow_build_data_update.htm&amp;type=5

Cloud Kicks needs to change the owner of a case when it has been open for more than 7 days. How should the administrator complete this requirement? 
Auto - Response Rules
Validation Rule
*Escalation Rule
Assignment Rule
Explanation: The correct answer is C. Escalation Rule. According to Salesforce's documentation, Escalation rules can be used to reassign ownership of a case after a certain period of time, based on criteria such as the case's age. Auto-Response Rules are used to send an automatic email response to the user who created a case or to the contact associated with the case. Validation Rules are used to ensure that certain criteria are met before a record can be saved, while Assignment Rules are used to assign records to specific users or teams based on specific criteria. Therefore, option A, B, and D are not appropriate solutions for the scenario described in the question.

Cloud Kicks intends to protect backups by using the data export Service. Which two considerations should the administrator remember when Scheduling the export? Choose 2 answers. 
Metadata Backups are limited by sandbox refresh intervals.
*Data Backups are limited to weekly or monthly intervals.
Data export service should be run from a sandbox.
*Metadata backups must be run via a separate process.
Explanation: Answer B is correct because the data export service only allows scheduling of backups on a weekly or monthly basis. This means that Cloud Kicks cannot schedule backups more frequently than that. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.admin_exportdata.htm&amp;type=5 
Answer D is also correct because metadata backups must be run separately and cannot be scheduled through the data export service. This means that the administrator must ensure that metadata backups are being performed through another process. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.admin_backup_metdata.htm&amp;type=5 
Answer A is incorrect because it is not directly related to the scheduling of backups using the data export service. Sandbox refresh intervals may impact metadata backups, but it is not relevant to the scheduling of data backups using the data export service. 
Answer C is incorrect because the data export service can be run from any Salesforce environment, not just a sandbox.

Dreamhouse Realty agents are double-booking open house event nights. The event manager wants to create an event submission process to help agents fill in event details and request dates. How should an administrator accomplish the request? 
Create a workflow role to update the Event Date Field.
*Create an approval process on the Campaign object.
Create a sharing rule so that other agents can view events.
Create a campaign for agents to request event dates.
Explanation: B is the correct answer because it suggests creating an approval process on the Campaign object. This means that when an agent submits their event details and request dates, it would go through an approval process where the event manager can review and approve or reject the request. This ensures that there is a centralized process in place to manage and control the event bookings, preventing double-booking. 
On the other hand, the other options are incorrect because they do not address the issue of double-booking open house event nights. 
Option A suggests creating a workflow role to update the Event Date Field, which is not an appropriate solution as it does not address the approval and management aspect of the event booking process.
Option C suggests creating a sharing rule to allow other agents to view events. While this may be helpful for collaborative purposes, it does not solve the problem of double-booking as it does not provide a structured process for agents to request event dates.
Option D suggests creating a campaign for agents to request event dates. While this may seem reasonable, it does not address the approval process needed to ensure that the bookings are properly managed and coordinated to avoid double-booking.

At Cloud Kicks sales reps use discounts on the opportunity record to help win sales on products. When an opportunity is won, they then have to manually apply the discount up the related opportunity products. The sales manager has asked if there is a way to automate this time consuming task. What should the administrator use to deliver this requirement? 
*Flow Builder
Approval Process
Prebuild Macro
Formula field
Explanation: Option A, Flow Builder, is the correct answer because it allows for the automation of processes and tasks. With Flow Builder, the administrator can create a process that automatically applies the discount to related opportunity products when an opportunity is won. Approval Process (Option B) is used for gaining approvals for record changes and does not automate tasks. Prebuild Macro (Option C) is a feature in Microsoft Excel, not Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Formula field (Option D) is used to calculate and display data on a record, but cannot automate tasks.

Universal container has a contact Lightning record Page with a component that shows LinkedIn data. The sales team would like to only show this component to sales users when they are on their mobile phones. Choose 2 answers. 
Filter the component visibility with User &gt; Profile &gt; name = sales User.
*Filter the component visibility with Form Factor = phone
*Filter the component visibility with view = Mobile/Tablet.
Filter the component visibility with User &gt; Role &gt; Name = Sales User.
Explanation: Answer B is correct because it specifically filters for the form factor of the device being used, which is necessary for showing the component only on mobile phones. Answer C is also correct because it filters for the view, which can also be used to determine if the user is on a mobile device. 
Answer A is incorrect because it filters based on the user's profile name, which does not necessarily ensure that they are a sales user on a mobile device. Answer D is incorrect because it filters based on the user's role name, which also does not ensure that they are using a mobile device.

An Administrator at DreamHouse Realty wants an easier way to assign an agent capacity and skill set.  Which feature should the administrator enable to meet this requirement? 
Knowledge Management.
*Omni-Channel
Escalation Rules
Territory Management
Explanation: B is the correct answer because Omni-Channel is a feature in Salesforce Marketing Cloud that allows for efficient routing of work to agents based on their capacity and skill set. This feature enables administrators to assign work to agents across different channels like email, social media, and chat while also providing real-time metrics and reporting. 
A is incorrect because Knowledge Management is a feature that allows organizations to create, manage, and share knowledge articles with customers and employees. It does not directly address the need for agent capacity and skill set assignment.
C is incorrect because Escalation Rules are used to define how cases are automatically escalated to a higher level of support when certain criteria are met. It does not deal with the direct assignment of agents to work based on their skills and capacity.
D is incorrect because Territory Management is used to define and manage sales territories for sales representatives. It does not address the need for agent capacity and skill set assignment.

New Leads need to be routed to the correct sales person based on the lead address. How should the administrator configure this requirement? 
Create formula field.
*Use lead assignment rules.
Assign with an escalation rule.
Configure a validation rule
Explanation: B is the correct answer because lead assignment rules in Salesforce Marketing Cloud are designed to configure the routing of leads to the appropriate salesperson based on specific criteria such as lead address. Formula fields are used to calculate a value based on other fields in the record, while validation rules ensure that data entered into a field meets specific criteria. Escalation rules are designed to notify others when an issue has not been addressed after a set period of time. Therefore, options A, C, and D are not relevant to this requirement.

What are three settings an administrator should configure to make it easy for approvers to respond to approval requests? Choose 3 answers. 
Update the organizations chatter setting to allow approvals.
*Enable the organizations Email approval response setting.
*Specify initial submission actions within the approval process.
*Add the Items to approve component to the approvers home page.
Create a flow to automatically approve all records.
Explanation: B, C, and D are the correct answers because they are the configurations that will make it easier for approvers to respond to approval requests. 
A is incorrect because updating the organization's chatter setting to allow approvals does not necessarily make it easier for approvers to respond to requests. 
E is also incorrect because creating a flow to automatically approve all records does not involve the approver in the approval process, which defeats the purpose of having an approval process.

The Cloud Kicks sales manager wants to boost productivity by providing insights at the start of each day. Which three sales-specific standard Lightning components should administrator add to the homepage to meet this requirement? Choose 3 answers. 
Activities
Path
*Assistant
*Key Deals
*Performance chart.
Explanation: Salesforce's documentation states that C, D, and E are the correct answers because they are all sales-specific standard Lightning components that can provide insights and help boost productivity. 
- Assistant (C) uses artificial intelligence to provide personalized insights and recommendations to the user based on their sales activities and data.
- Key Deals (D) shows the user a list of their most important deals and enables them to take action on those deals directly from the homepage.
- Performance Chart (E) provides a visual representation of the user's sales data, allowing them to quickly identify trends and take action based on the insights provided.
Option A, Activities, is incorrect because it only shows the user their upcoming tasks and events, which may not necessarily provide insights or boost productivity. 
Option B, Path, is also incorrect because it is a tool for guiding users through a predefined process, rather than providing insights or boosting productivity.

Northern Trail outfitters has hired interns to enter Leads into Salesforce and has requested a way to identify these new records from existing Leads. What approach should an administrator take to meet this requirement? 
Set up Web-to-Lead form the interns use.
*Define a record type and assign it to the interns.
Create a separate Lead Lightning App.
Update the active Leas Assignment Rules.
Explanation: B is the correct answer because defining a record type and assigning it to the interns allows them to create new Leads with a specific record type, which can be easily identified as new records from the existing Leads. This approach does not involve any external forms or apps and is a simple and straightforward solution for identifying new Leads entered by interns. 
A is incorrect because setting up a web-to-lead form does not specifically assign a record type to the interns, and there is no guarantee that the Leads entered through the form will be identified as new records from existing Leads. 
C is incorrect because creating a separate Lead Lightning app is an unnecessary and complicated solution for this specific requirement. 
D is incorrect because updating the active Lead Assignment Rules does not address the requirement to identify new Leads entered by interns. It only affects how Leads are assigned to specific users or queues.

Once an opportunity reaches the negotiation stage at Cloud Kicks, the Amount fields becomes required for sales users. Sales managers need to be able to move opportunities into this stage without knowing the amount.  How should the administrator require this field during the negotiation stage for sales users but allow their managers to make changes? 
Make the field required for all users.
Create to formula field to fill in the field for managers.
Assign the administrator profile to the managers.
*Configure a validation rule to meet the criteria.
Explanation: The correct answer is D. Configuring a validation rule to meet the criteria would allow the administrator to require the Amount field during the negotiation stage for sales users while allowing their managers to make changes. Validation rules can be set up to only enforce the field requirement for specific users or user profiles. 
Option A (making the field required for all users) would not allow sales managers to move opportunities into the negotiation stage without filling in the Amount field, which is not desired according to the question prompt. 
Option B (creating a formula field) may not address the issue of making the field required for sales users, and it may not be practical since it involves creating a new field. 
Option C (assigning the administrator profile to managers) is not a solution to require the Amount field during the negotiation stage for sales users.

The administrator for AW Computing is working with a user who is having trouble logging in to salesforce. What should the administrator do to identify why the user is unable to login? 
Review the Security token.
Review the password history.
Review the Password policies.
*Review the Login history
Explanation: D is the correct answer because reviewing the login history will help the administrator identify any errors or issues that might be causing the user to be unable to login. It will show the date and time of the user's attempts to login, and any error messages associated with those attempts. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not directly address the issue of why the user is unable to login. Reviewing the security token is only necessary if the user is logging in from outside the company's network, reviewing the password history is irrelevant if the user is unable to login at present, and reviewing the password policies is only necessary if the user is unable to create a password that meets the policies.

Sales reps at Ursa Solar are having difficulty managing deals. The leadership team has asked the administrator to help sales reps prioritize and close more deals. What should the administrator do to close more deals? 
Einstein Lead Scoring
Einstein Search Personalization
Einstein Activity Capture
*Einstein Opportunity Scoring
Explanation: D is the correct answer because it directly addresses the issue of managing and prioritizing deals. Einstein Opportunity Scoring provides a score and insights for each opportunity, helping sales reps prioritize their efforts and focus on the most promising deals. 
A is incorrect because it only scores leads, not opportunities. B is incorrect because it customizes search results for individual users, not directly helping with deal management. C is incorrect because it tracks activities, but doesn't directly offer insights into prioritizing deals.

The administrator at Ursa Major Solar has created a custom report type and built a report for sales operation team. However, none of the user are able to access the report. Which two options could cause this issue? Choose 2 answers.  
*The custom report type is in development.
The user's profile is missing view access.
The org has reached its limit of custom report types.
*The report is saved in a private folder
Explanation: A is the correct answer because if the custom report type is in development, it means it has not been fully completed and may not be accessible to users.
D is the correct answer because if the report is saved in a private folder, only the owner of the folder and users with the appropriate permissions will be able to access it. Other users will not have access to the report.
B is incorrect because missing view access on the user's profile would prevent them from accessing any reports, not just a specific report.
C is incorrect because reaching the limit of custom report types would not prevent users from accessing a specific report. It would only prevent the creation of additional custom report types. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.reports_defining_report_types.htm&amp;type=5  

Northern trail Outfitter wants to use contract hierarchy in its org to display contact association. What should the administrator take into consideration regarding the contact hierarchy? 
*Contacts displays in the contact hierarchy are limited to record-level access by User.
Contact Hierarchy is limited to only 3,000 contacts at one time.
Customizing hierarchy columns changes the recently viewed Contacts list view.
Sharing setting are ignored by contacts displayed in the Contact Hierarchy.
Explanation: A is the correct answer because Salesforce Marketing Cloud's documentation states that contacts displayed in the contact hierarchy are limited to record-level access by the user. This means that users only have access to the contacts that they have been granted access to, based on their user profile and sharing settings.
B is incorrect because there is no mention of a limit to the number of contacts that can be displayed in the contact hierarchy.
C is incorrect because customizing hierarchy columns does not affect the recently viewed contacts list view.
D is incorrect because sharing settings are still applied to contacts displayed in the contact hierarchy.

An administrator needs to create a one-to-many relationship between two objects with limited access to child records. What type of field should the administrator use? 
Roll-up summary
*Master-detail field
Cross Object formula
Lookup field
Explanation: B is the correct answer because a master-detail field is the best option for creating a one-to-many relationship where the parent object controls access to its child records. The master object in a master-detail relationship controls the ownership and access to its related detail records. This means that the parent object's sharing settings will apply to all of its child records. 
Option A, roll-up summary fields, are used to aggregate data from child records onto the parent record, but do not limit access to child records.
Option C, cross-object formulas, are used to reference fields on a related object to perform calculations, but do not create a relationship between the objects.
Option D, lookup fields, allow users to select a related record on the parent object, but do not control access to child records.

The administrator at Cloud Kicks deleted a custom field but realized there is a business unit that still uses the field. What should an administrator take into consideration when undeleting the field? 
The field needs to be re-added to reports.
*The field history will remain deleted.
The field needs to be restored from the recycle bin.
The field needs to be re-added to page Layouts.
Explanation: Based on Salesforce's documentation, B is the correct answer because when a custom field is deleted, the field history is also deleted. It cannot be recovered for that specific field. Therefore, the administrator must understand that the field history will remain deleted even if the field is undeleted. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.deleting_fields.htm&amp;type=5 
A, C, and D are incorrect answers because they do not address the specific consideration related to the field history. A does not mention the field history, C is related to restoring the field from the recycle bin (which is correct), but it does not highlight the specific consequence of the field history being deleted. D states that the field needs to be re-added to page layouts, but it does not address the field history aspect.

The DreamHouse Realty team has a master-detail relationship set up with open house as the parent object and visitors as the child object.  What type of field should the administrator add to the open house object to track number of visitors? 
*Roll-up Summary.
Multi-select Picklist
Cross-object formula field
Indirect lookup
Explanation: A is the correct answer because a Roll-up Summary field can calculate the total number of child records (visitors) associated with a parent record (open house). This is the most efficient and straightforward way to track the number of visitors for each open house. 
B is incorrect because a Multi-select Picklist is used to select multiple options from a predefined list, which is not applicable in this scenario. 
C is incorrect because a Cross-object formula field is used to display data from related records through a formula expression, but it cannot perform the calculation needed to track the number of visitors. 
D is incorrect because an Indirect lookup is used to find related records through a lookup relationship, but it cannot perform the calculation needed to track the number of visitors.

An administrator at Northern Trail Outfitters is unable to add a new user in salesforce. What could cause this issue? 
The Username is not a corporate email address
The username is less than 80 characters.
The Username is a fake email address.
*The Username is already in use.
Explanation: According to Salesforce Marketing Cloud's documentation, if an administrator is unable to add a new user in Salesforce, it could be because the username is already in use. This means that someone else in the organization has already been assigned that username, and it cannot be used again for another user. Therefore, option D is the correct answer. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not address the specific issue of the username already being in use.

The administrator at Cloud Kicks has been told that users are unable to add repeating tasks in salesforce. Which two solutions the administrator use to ensure users are able to do this? Choose 2 answers.  
*Enable creation of Recurring Tasks in Activity Settings
Disable shares Activities.
*Add create Recurring series of Tasks field on Page Layouts
Turn on Task Notifications service.
Explanation: A is the correct answer because it enables the creation of recurring tasks in the activity settings, thus allowing users to add repeating tasks. 
C is also correct because adding the "create recurring series of tasks" field to page layouts will make it easier for users to create recurring tasks. 
B and D are incorrect because disabling shared activities and turning on task notifications service do not relate to the issue of users being unable to add repeating tasks. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.tasks_enable_recurring_tasks_lex.htm&amp;type=5 

Cloud Kicks executives have noticed the opportunity Expected Revenue Field displays incorrect values. How should the administrator correct this? 
Update the expected revenue associated with the stage.
Adjust the forecast category associated with the stage.
Modify the closed won value associated with the stage.
*Change the probability associated with the stage.
Explanation: According to Salesforce Marketing Cloud's documentation, the expected revenue field is calculated using the probability and the amount in the opportunity record. Therefore, if the expected revenue field displays incorrect values, the administrator should change the probability associated with the stage. Answer D is correct because changing the probability will impact the calculation of the expected revenue, which is the primary concern raised in the question. 
Answers A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not address the issue of the expected revenue field displaying incorrect values. Updating the expected revenue associated with the stage (option A) will only change the value in that field, but it will not fix the underlying problem causing the incorrect calculation. Adjusting the forecast category associated with the stage (option B) and modifying the closed won value associated with the stage (option C) similarly may impact other fields or reports but will not solve the specific problem of the expected revenue field displaying incorrect values.

The administrator at Cloud Kicks is trying to debug a screen flow that create contacts. One of the variables in the flow is missing on the debug screen. What could cause this issue? 
*The 'available for input' checkbox was unchecked.
The flow is an inactive version
The field type is unsupported by debugging.
The available form output checkbox was unchecked.
Explanation: According to Salesforce's documentation, the correct answer is A. The 'available for input' checkbox was unchecked.
This is because when creating a screen flow, if a variable is not marked as 'available for input', it will not be displayed on the debug screen. This means that the variable cannot be directly updated or modified during the debug process.
Option B, which states that the flow is an inactive version, is incorrect because the question does not mention anything about the flow being inactive. Inactive versions of the flow can still be debugged, and this would not cause a variable to be missing on the debug screen.
Option C, stating that the field type is unsupported by debugging, is also incorrect. The documentation does not mention any specific types of fields that are unsupported for debugging, and there is no indication in the question that the field type is the cause of the missing variable on the debug screen.
Option D, indicating that the available form output checkbox was unchecked, is also incorrect. The question does not mention anything about a form or form output, so this option is not relevant to the issue described.

The administrator at universal containers has a screen flow that helps users create new leads. When lead source is ''Search Engine'', the administrator needs to require the user to choose a specific search engine from a picklist. If lead source is not ''Search Engine'', this picklist should be hidden. How should the administrator complete this requirement? 
Assign a decision element to direct the user to a second screen to hold specific search engine only when a lead source is ''Search Engine''.
Use an assignment element, one for when lead source is ''Search Engine'' and one for everything else.
*Create a picklist for specific search engine, and set conditional visibility so that is only shown when lead source is ''Search Engine''.
Configure a picklist for specific search engine, and use a validation rule to conditionally show only when lead source is ''Search Engine''
Explanation: Option C is the correct answer because it suggests creating a picklist for specific search engine and setting conditional visibility so that it is only shown when lead source is "Search Engine." This satisfies the requirement of requiring the user to choose a specific search engine from a picklist when lead source is "Search Engine" and hiding the picklist when the lead source is not "Search Engine." 
Option A is not correct because it suggests directing the user to a second screen only when lead source is "Search Engine," which does not address the requirement of requiring the user to choose a specific search engine from a picklist. 
Option B is not correct because it suggests using an assignment element for both scenarios - when lead source is "Search Engine" and when it is not. This does not address the requirement of hiding the picklist when the lead source is not "Search Engine." 
Option D is not correct because it suggests using a validation rule to conditionally show the picklist only when lead source is "Search Engine," which is not possible in screen flow. Validation rules are used in record-level operations and cannot be used in screen flow.

Cloud Kicks needs to ensure appropriate shipping details are used in orders. Reps should have a streamlined solution to update the shipping address on selected orders associated with an account when the shipping address is changed on the account. How should the administrator deliver this requirement? 
An autolaunched flow on the order page that updates all open orders shipping addresses whenever the account shipping addresses changes.
An autolaunched flow on the account page that updates all open orders shipping addresses whenever the account shipping addresses changes.
A screen flow on the order page that lets the reps choose the updated account shipping address in all open associated orders
*A screen flow on the account page that lets the reps choose the updated account shipping address in all open associated orders
Explanation: The correct answer is D because, in the given scenario, the requirement is to provide reps with a streamlined solution to update the shipping address on selected orders associated with an account when the shipping address is changed on the account. 
Option A is incorrect because an autolaunched flow on the order page would update all open orders' shipping addresses whenever the account shipping address changes. This does not provide a streamlined solution for reps to choose the updated shipping address on selected orders.
Option B is incorrect because an autolaunched flow on the account page would update all open orders' shipping addresses whenever the account shipping address changes. Again, this does not provide a streamlined solution for reps to choose the updated shipping address on selected orders.
Option C is incorrect because a screen flow on the order page would only allow reps to choose the updated account shipping address for all open associated orders. This does not match the requirement of selecting the updated shipping address for selected orders. 
Option D is the correct answer because a screen flow on the account page would provide reps with the ability to choose the updated shipping address for all open associated orders. This meets the requirement of a streamlined solution for reps to update shipping details on selected orders.

Sales managers would like to know what could be implemented to surface important values based on the stage of the opportunity. Which tool should an administrator use to meet the requirement? 
Dynamic forms
*Path key fields
Opportunity processes
Workflow rules
Explanation: B is the correct answer because Path key fields allow an administrator to specify important values for each stage of the opportunity, making it easy for sales managers to quickly see what values are important at each stage. Dynamic forms, opportunity processes, and workflow rules do not specifically address the need to surface important values based on the stage of the opportunity.

The sales team at Ursa Major Solar has asked the administrator to automate an outbound message. What should the administrator utilize to satisfy the request? 
Process builder
Task assignment
*Workflow rule
Flow builder
Explanation: C is the correct answer because according to Salesforce's documentation, a Workflow rule is a way to automate standard internal procedures and processes to save time across your org. It is a powerful tool used to send outbound messages or emails. Process builder is used to automate complex business processes and tasks assignment is used to assign tasks to specific users or queues. Flow builder is used to build custom business processes and logic. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.workflow_managing_outbound_messages.htm&amp;type=5

Cloud Kicks has the organization-wide sharing default set to private on the shoe object. The sales manager should be able to view a report containing shoe records for all of the sales reps on their team. Which 2 items should the administrator configure to provide appropriate access to the report? Choose 2 answers.  
*Custom report type.
*Folder access
Report subscription
*Field level security
Explanation: A. Custom report type: The sales manager needs to view shoe records for all of the sales reps on their team. By creating a custom report type, the administrator can include necessary fields and relationships to ensure the sales manager has access to all relevant data in the report.
B. Folder access: By granting the sales manager access to the appropriate folder containing the report, they will be able to view and access the report. Without the folder access, the sales manager may not be able to see or find the report.
C. Report subscription: Report subscription is not a relevant configuration in this scenario. It allows users to schedule and automatically receive reports via email or Chatter on a regular basis. However, it does not directly address the sales manager's access to the report.
D. Field level security: Field level security determines the visibility and editability of specific fields in an object. In this case, the organization-wide sharing default is set to private on the shoe object. To provide appropriate access to the report, the administrator may need to adjust the field level security settings to ensure the sales manager can view the required fields in the report.

The events manager at dream house realty has a hot lead from a successful open house that needs to become a contact with an associated opportunity. How should this be accomplished from the campaign keeping the associated campaign member history? 
Delete the lead and create a new contact and opportunity.
Clone the lead and convert the cloned record to a contact.
*Convert the lead from the campaign member detail page.
Add a contact from a campaign member detail page.
Explanation: The correct answer is C: Convert the lead from the campaign member detail page.
This is the correct answer because the lead from the successful open house already exists in the campaign member history. By converting the lead from the campaign member detail page, the lead will become a contact with an associated opportunity while still maintaining the campaign member history. 
Option A is incorrect because it suggests deleting the lead which would result in losing the campaign member history. 
Option B is incorrect because cloning the lead would create a duplicate record and not merge the lead's campaign member history with the new contact and associated opportunity.
Option D is incorrect because it suggests adding a new contact from the campaign member detail page, which would not include the associated opportunity and campaign member history.

A user at Universal Containers left the company. The administrator needs to create new user for their replacement, but they have assigned all available users licenses. What should the administrator do to free up users licenses for the new users? 
*Deactivate the former employees user record.
Delete former employees user record.
Freeze former employees user record.
Change the formers users record to the new user.
Explanation: A is the correct answer because deactivating the former employee's user record will free up the user license for the new user. This option ensures that the former employee's data is preserved in the system for future reference or audits. 
B is incorrect because deleting the former employee's user record will permanently delete all the associated data, which may be required for auditing or historical purposes.
C is incorrect because freezing the former employee's user record will not free up the user license, and the new user will not be able to use the license.
D is incorrect because changing the former user's record to the new user will not free up the user license. The former employee's user record should be deactivated, and a new user record should be created for the replacement. https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/feed/0D54S00000A8prvSAB 

Universal Containers administrator has been asked to create a many-to-many relationship between two existing custom objects. Which two steps should the administrator take when enabling the many-to-many relationship? Choose 2 answers.  
*Create a junction with a custom object.
*Create two master detail relationships on the new object.
Create two lookup relationships on the new object.
Create URL fields on a custom object.
Explanation: According to Salesforce's documentation, answers A and B are the correct options for enabling a many-to-many relationship between two existing custom objects.
Explanation for answer A: Creating a junction with a custom object means creating a new custom object that acts as a junction between the two existing objects. This junction object will hold the relationship between the two objects and allow for a many-to-many relationship.
Explanation for answer B: Creating two master-detail relationships on the new object ensures that both of the existing custom objects are linked to the new object as master objects. This establishes the many-to-many relationship, as each master object can have multiple detail objects associated with it.
Explanation for answers C and D: Answers C and D are incorrect because they do not describe the correct steps for enabling a many-to-many relationship. Creating two lookup relationships on the new object would establish a many-to-one relationship, not a many-to-many relationship. Creating URL fields on a custom object is unrelated to creating a many-to-many relationship and does not address the requirements of the scenario. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.relationships_manytomany.htm&amp;type=5 

The administrator at Cloud Kicks has been asked to change the company's Shoe style field to prevent users from selecting more than one style on a record. Which two steps should an administrator do to accomplish this? Choose 2 answers.  
Reactivate the appropriate Shoe Style values after the field type changes.
Select the ''Choose only one value ''checkbox on the picklist field.
*Back-up the Shoe Style values in existing records.
*Change the field type from a multi-select picklist field to a picklist field.
Explanation: C - Back-up the Shoe Style values in existing records is important as changing the field type from multi-select picklist could potentially result in loss of data. The data needs to be backed-up before making any changes to the field.
D - Changing the field type from a multi-select picklist field to a picklist field is the correct answer. This will prevent users from selecting more than one style on a record. 
A - Reactivating the appropriate Shoe Style values after the field type changes is not necessary, as the values will automatically carry over to the new picklist field.
B - Selecting the "Choose only one value" checkbox on the picklist field is not a valid option in this scenario, as it is only applicable for picklist fields and not multi-select picklist fields. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.notes_on_changing_custom_field_types.htm&amp;type=5

The Human resources department at Northern Trail outfitters wants employees to provide feedback about the manager using a custom object in Salesforce. It is important that managers are unable to see the feedback records from their staff. How should an administrator configure the custom object to meet this requirement? 
*Uncheck grant access using Hierarchies.
Define a criteria-based sharing rules.
Set the default external access to private.
Configure an owner-based sharing rules.
Explanation: A: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.security_controlling_access_using_hierarchies.htm&amp;type=5

An administrator at Universal Container needs an automated way to delete records based on field values. What automated solution should the administrator use? 
Workflow
Process Builder
*Flow Builder
Automation Studio
Explanation: C is the correct answer because Flow Builder is a tool used for creating automated processes within Salesforce that can update, create, delete, or access records based on specific criteria. It allows users to build complex business processes without requiring code. Workflow (A) and Process Builder (B) also allow for certain automated actions to be taken based on field values, but they have more limited functionality than Flow Builder. Automation Studio (D) is a tool in Marketing Cloud, which is a separate platform from Salesforce, and is not relevant to this question. Therefore, C is the best option for the administrator to use for their automated solution.

Universal Containers (UC) customers have provided feedback that their support cases are not being responded to quickly enough. UC wants to send all unassigned Cases that have been opened for more than two hours to an urgent Case queue and alert the support manager. Which feature should an administrator configure to meet this requirement? 
*Case Escalation Rules
Case Dashboard Refreshes
Case Scheduled Report
Case Assignment Rules
Explanation: To meet the requirement of sending unassigned cases that have been opened for more than two hours to an urgent case queue and alert the support manager, the administrator should configure:
A. Case Escalation Rules.
Case Escalation Rules allow the administrator to automatically escalate cases based on certain criteria, such as the time they have been open. By setting up a Case Escalation Rule with a time-based rule entry, the administrator can define the condition for cases that have been opened for more than two hours. The rule can be configured to assign these cases to the urgent case queue and trigger an alert to the support manager, ensuring prompt attention to the cases that require immediate action.

Dream house realty needs to use consistent picklist values in the category field on accounts and cases, with values respective to record types. Choose 2 options. 
Multi-select picklist
*Dependent picklist
*Global picklist
Custom picklist
Explanation: The correct answer should be Dependent Picklist and Global Picklist. Here're why:B. Dependent picklist: Dependent picklists allow you to define a relationship between two picklist fields, where the values available in the dependent picklist are based on the value selected in the controlling picklist. This can be particularly useful when you want different picklist values based on record types to guide users and further improve data integrity with a dependent picklist. C. Global picklist: Global picklists provide a predefined set of values that can be reused across multiple objects. This ensures consistency in picklist values, making it a suitable choice when you want the same set of values for the category field on both accounts and cases.A. Multi-select picklist: Multi-select picklists allow users to choose multiple values from a list. However, they might not be the best choice if you want different values for the category field based on record types.D. Custom picklist: The term "custom picklist" is quite generic and can refer to both dependent and independent picklists. It could be a valid choice if you choose to implement the category field as a custom picklist and then configure it as either a dependent picklist or use a global picklist to ensure consistent values across accounts and cases based on record types. For ensuring consistency between accounts and cases with values respective to record types, dependent picklists or global picklists are more appropriate.See reference here: <a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/picklist_admin/picklist_admin_start">https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/picklist_admin/picklist_admin_start</a>

Support agent at Cloud Kicks are spending too much time finding resources to solve cases. The agents need a more efficient way to find documentation and similar cases from the Case page layout. How should an administrator meet this requirement? 
Create a custom object to capture popular case resolutions.
Use an interview flow to capture Case details.
Direct users to Global Search to look for similar cases.
*Configure Knowledge with articles and data categories.
Explanation: The correct answer is D because Salesforce's Knowledge feature is specifically designed to provide a centralized location for documentation and resources. By configuring Knowledge with articles and data categories, the support agents can easily access relevant information directly from the Case page layout, reducing the time and effort required to search for resources. Options A and B are unrelated to the requirement of finding resources and are not an efficient solution. Option C suggests directing users to the Global Search, which may not provide targeted results for the agents' needs.

Which three items are available in the mobile navigation menu? Choose 3 answers.  
*Lightning App Pages
Lightning Home Page
*Chatter
Utility Bar
*Dashboards
Explanation: A, C, and E are the correct answers because they are the three items that are listed as available in the mobile navigation menu in Salesforce's documentation. B and D are incorrect because they are not listed as options in the mobile navigation menu, according to the documentation. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.salesforce_app_customize_nav_menu.htm&amp;type=5

Which tool should an administrator use to identify and fix potential session vulnerabilities? Choose 1. 
Field History Tracking
Setup Audit Trail
*Security Health Check
Organization-Wide Defaults
Explanation: The correct answer is C, Security Health Check. This tool provides a comprehensive assessment of an organization's security posture and identifies potential vulnerabilities in sessions as well as other areas of the org. Field History Tracking and Setup Audit Trail are useful for tracking changes made to fields and setup configurations respectively, but they do not specifically identify session vulnerabilities. Organization-Wide Defaults determine the default access level for records, but they do not address session vulnerabilities.

Users at Universal Containers would like to visually see the sales stages on an Opportunity page. The administrator is configuring path for Opportunities. Which is an important consideration for path configuration? 
Kanban views for Path must be configured manually.
The Owner field can be edited in the key fields Panel.
Celebrations are unable to be added to a path.
*Path can include guidance and key fields for each stage.
Explanation: D is the correct answer because this matches what is stated in Salesforce Marketing Cloud's documentation. The path feature in Salesforce allows for customized guidance and key fields to be added for each stage of an opportunity, which can help users understand what needs to be done to move the opportunity forward. This is an important consideration for setting up the path feature to ensure that it is useful for the intended audience. 
Answers A and B are unrelated to the question and do not provide any useful information about considerations for path configuration. Answer C is incorrect, as celebrations can be added to a path in Salesforce Marketing Cloud. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.path_considerations.htm&amp;type=5 

New leads need be routed to the correct Sales person based on the lead address. Choose 1. 
Configure validation rule
*Use lead assignment rule
Create a formula field
Assign with an escalation rule
Explanation: B is the correct answer because lead assignment rule is used to automatically assign leads to the correct salesperson based on certain criteria such as lead address, lead source, etc. This saves time and effort for the sales team and ensures that leads are distributed evenly. 
A validation rule is used to validate data entered into a record and ensure that it meets certain criteria before being saved. 
A formula field is used to calculate a value based on other fields in the record. 
An escalation rule is used to escalate a record or case to a higher level of support if it has not been resolved within a certain timeframe.

Dreamhouse Reality just announced its new home concierge offering. This product is unlike anything the company has offered in the past and follows a different business model. What Should the administrator Configure to meet this requirement? 
Create a quick action.
Create a new approval process.
*Create a new sales process.
Create a new Opportunity product.
Explanation: C is the correct answer because the company is introducing a new product with a different business model, which requires a new sales process to effectively sell and manage the product. Creating a quick action or a new approval process would not address the need for a new sales process. Creating a new Opportunity product may be relevant if the new product requires a unique product offering, but it does not address the broader need for a new sales process.

Which tool should an administrator use to review recent configuration changes made in their org? Choose 1.  
Critical Updates
Debug logs
*Setup Audit Trail
Field History Tracking
Explanation: The correct answer is C, Setup Audit Trail. This tool allows an administrator to review recent configuration changes made in their org. Critical Updates are used to inform administrators about updates that may impact their org's functionality. Debug logs are used to help identify problems and troubleshoot issues. Field History Tracking tracks changes made to specific fields on a record. None of these options provide a comprehensive record of recent configuration changes in an org, making Setup Audit Trail the correct answer.

Which three aspects of standard fields should an administrator customize? Choose 3 answers.  
*Picklist Values
*Help Text
*Field history tracking
Decimal Places
Field name
Explanation: A, B, and C are the correct answers because they are the three aspects of standard fields that an administrator can and should customize. 
A - Picklist values: This is important because the picklist values determine the options available for selection in a particular field. Depending on the type of data being entered, the picklist values may need to be customized to ensure accurate data collection.
B - Help Text: Customizing help text can help users better understand the purpose of a particular field and how to correctly enter data.
C - Field history tracking: This is important for tracking changes made to a particular field and maintaining an audit trail of data changes. 
D and E are incorrect answers as they are not aspects of standard fields that an administrator can or should customize. 
D - Decimal Places: Decimal places are generally determined by the data type of a field and cannot be customized by an administrator. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.customize_stdfields.htm&amp;type=5 
E - Field Name: Changing the name of a standard field is not recommended as it may cause confusion among users and cause issues with integrations and reporting.

Cloud Kicks wants to try out an app from the AppExchange to ensure that the app meets its needs. Which two options should the administrator suggest? Choose two answers. 
Test Drive in a production org.
*Download into a Trailhead Playground.
*Install in a sandbox.
Check edition compatibility.
Explanation: B is a correct answer because downloading an app into a Trailhead Playground allows for testing of the app without affecting a production environment. This provides a safe and controlled environment to test out the app's features and functionality.
C is also a correct answer because installing an app in a sandbox provides a similar safe and controlled environment for testing the app's features and functionality before rolling it out to a production environment.
A and D are incorrect answers because testing an app in a production org could potentially impact the organization's business processes and data. Additionally, checking edition compatibility is important, but it is not a suggestion for trying out an app from the AppExchange.

DreamHouse reality has an approval process. A manager attempts to approve the record but receives an error. What should an administrator review to troubleshoot this request? 
Add a delegated approver for the next approver in the process.
Update the field level security to view on fields that are updated in the process.
*Check if the user in the next approver is inactive or missing
Review the page layout to ensure, the fields updated in the process are visible
Explanation: C is the correct answer because it directly addresses the issue mentioned in the question - that the manager is receiving an error when attempting to approve the record. By checking if the user in the next approver is inactive or missing, the administrator can identify and resolve the issue preventing the approval process from continuing. 
A, B, and D are incorrect answers because they do not directly address the issue at hand. Adding a delegated approver or updating field level security may be necessary actions in certain approval processes, but they are not relevant to the current issue being faced by the manager. Reviewing the page layout may also be useful in some cases, but it is not specifically related to troubleshooting an error in the approval process.

What should an administrator use as an identifier when importing and updating records from a separate financial system? Choose 1. 
Auto-Number field
*External ID
Rich text field
Record ID
Explanation: B is the correct answer because an External ID should be used as an identifier when importing and updating records from a separate financial system. This is because an External ID is a unique identifier that can be created and assigned by the external system, allowing for easy synchronization and updating of records between the two systems. Auto-Number fields are generated by Salesforce and cannot be assigned by an external system, making them unsuitable for this purpose. Rich text fields are not unique identifiers and cannot be used to identify records. Record IDs are also generated by Salesforce and cannot be assigned by an external system.

The business development team at Cloud Kicks thinks the account creation process has too many fields to fill out and the page feels cluttered. They have requested the administrator to simplify the process. Which automation tool should an administrator use? 
Approval process
Workflow rule
*Flow builder
Validation rule
Explanation: C is the correct answer because Flow Builder is a tool that allows administrators to automate complex business processes by creating visual workflows with drag-and-drop efficiency. With Flow Builder, the administrator can simplify the account creation process by removing unnecessary fields and streamline the user experience. Approval Process is used when a record requires approval from one or more users or queue, Workflow Rule automatically updates or assigns fields based on specified criteria, and Validation Rule checks the accuracy of the data entered in a record before saving it. Therefore, these options are not relevant to the scenario given in the question.

Universal Containers (UC) would like to count the number of open cases associated with each account and update the account with this value every Friday evening. UC has several hundred open cases at any given time. What should the administrator use to complete this request? 
Use a record trigger flow.
Use a scheduled process builder.
Use a Roll-Up summary.
*Use a scheduled flow
Explanation: D is the correct answer because a scheduled flow can be set to run on a recurring basis (in this case, every Friday evening), gather the necessary data (count of open cases associated with each account), and then update the corresponding account records with this data. A record trigger flow and a scheduled process builder may not be able to handle the processing of data for hundreds of open cases at once, and a roll-up summary field would not be able to update the account records directly.

An administration needs to store the ID of record type of later use in a flow. Which kind of variable should the administrator use? 
Boolean variable
*Text variable
ID variable
Record variable
Explanation: B is the correct answer because the administration needs to store the ID of the record type for later use in a flow. The ID should be in text format, so a text variable should be used to store it. 
Answer A, Boolean variable, is incorrect because it only stores true or false values, which are not applicable for this scenario. 
Answer C, ID variable, is partially correct, but the ID variable stores ID values in a specific format, and it may not be compatible with other text functions used in the flow. Therefore, a text variable is a more suitable option. 
Answer D, Record variable, is incorrect because it stores the complete set of data for a record, not just the ID value. In this case, only the ID value is needed, so using a record variable would be inefficient.

An administrator at Universal Containers is reviewing current security settings in the company's Salesforce org. What Should the administrator do to prevent unauthorized access to Salesforce? 
Disable TLS requirements for sessions.
*Enable multi factor authentication
Customize organization wide default
Enable caching and autocomplete on login page
Explanation: B is the correct answer because enabling multi-factor authentication is a proven method of preventing unauthorized access to Salesforce. It requires users to go through an extra step beyond password authentication to confirm their identity. This greatly reduces the risk of someone accessing the org with a stolen or compromised login credential. 
A is incorrect because disabling TLS requirements would actually make the org less secure. TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a protocol that encrypts data and helps prevent eavesdropping and tampering during data transmission. Disabling it would make it easier for attackers to intercept and manipulate sensitive information.
C is incorrect because customizing organization-wide defaults is a configuration setting that can impact user permissions and access, but does not directly prevent unauthorized access.
D is incorrect because enabling caching and autocomplete on the login page would actually increase the risk of unauthorized access. It could allow someone with physical access to a shared device to easily log in as another user without knowing their password.

Cloud Kicks has asked the administrator to test a new screen flow that create contacts. What are two key components of testing the flow? Choose 2 answers.  
Set Up a flow interview to test the flow.
*Run the flow using it to create contacts.
Use Debug to test the flow in Flow Builder.
*Test the flow in a sandbox.
Explanation: B is correct because running the flow is necessary to test whether it successfully creates contacts. 
D is correct because testing the flow in a sandbox allows for testing in a controlled environment that does not affect real data. 
A is incorrect because setting up a flow interview is not necessary to test the flow, although it can be a way to walk through the flow with a user-like experience. 
C is incorrect because using Debug in Flow Builder is a way to troubleshoot and identify problems in the flow, but it is not a necessary component of testing the flow.

Cloud Kicks want its reports to show a Fiscal Year that starts on February 1 and has 12 months. How Should the Administrator Address this requirement? 
Set the Fiscal Year to Custom and the starting month as February.
Set the Fiscal Year to Custom and the duration to 4 quarters.
*Set the Fiscal Year to Standard and the starting month as February.
Set the Fiscal Year to Standard and the duration to 12 months.
Explanation: The correct answer is C because Salesforce Marketing Cloud's documentation states that the Standard fiscal year starts on January 1 and ends on December 31. However, the administrator can modify it to start on a different month other than January, which is February in this case, by setting the starting month as February. Option A is incorrect because it suggests setting the Fiscal Year to Custom, which can be more complicated and time-consuming to maintain. Option B is incorrect because it suggests setting the duration to 4 quarters, which does not guarantee that the fiscal year will begin on February 1. Option D is incorrect because it suggests setting the duration to 12 months, which is the standard duration for a fiscal year and does not address the requirement of starting on February 1.

Users at Cloud Kicks want to be able to create a task that will repeat every two weeks. What should an administrator do to meet the requirement? 
*Enable Creation of Recurring Tasks.
Flow to create recurring tasks.
Workflow rule to create recurring tasks.
Turn on Recurring Activities.
Explanation: The correct answer is A. Enable Creation of Recurring Tasks. This is because Salesforce Marketing Cloud provides an option to create recurring tasks, which allows users at Cloud Kicks to create tasks that will repeat every two weeks. 
Option B - Flow to create recurring tasks is incorrect because although flows can be used to automate tasks, they do not provide a specific option to create recurring tasks. 
Option C - Workflow rule to create recurring tasks is also incorrect because workflow rules cannot create recurring tasks. 
Option D - Turn on Recurring Activities is incorrect because this option only applies to events, not tasks.

Aw Computing needs to capture a loss reason in rich text field when an opportunity is Closed lost. How should an administrator configure this requirement? 
Select the requirement checkbox next to the loss reason field on the page layout.
*Create a validation rule to display an error if stage is Closed lost and Loss Reason is blank.
Check the required checkbox on the Loss Reason field in Object Manger.
Configure a workflow rule to display an error if Loss Reason is blank
Explanation: B is the correct answer because it provides the most appropriate solution to capture a loss reason in a rich text field when an opportunity is Closed lost. By creating a validation rule, the administrator can ensure that the Loss Reason field is populated before the opportunity can be closed as lost. This will help in capturing important information and also prevent any data inconsistencies. 
A is incorrect because selecting the requirement checkbox next to the loss reason field on the page layout does not guarantee that the field will be populated when an opportunity is closed as lost. 
C is incorrect because checking the required checkbox on the Loss Reason field in Object Manager will make the field mandatory, but it does not specifically address the scenario where an opportunity is closed as lost. 
D is incorrect because configuring a workflow rule to display an error if Loss Reason is blank only alerts users after the opportunity has already been closed as lost. This does not ensure that the Loss Reason field is populated before the opportunity can be closed as lost.

Cloud Kicks has a custom object named Shoe. The administrator has been asked to ensure that a relationship is created between Account and Shoe to prevent orphaned Shoe records. What should the administrator do to complete this requirement? 
Create an indirect lookup
Create an encrypted lookup
Create a hierarchical lookup
*Create a master-detail lookup.
Explanation: The correct answer is D, to create a master-detail lookup. This is because a master-detail relationship is used to create a parent-child relationship between two objects, where the parent object controls certain behaviors of the child object. In this scenario, creating a master-detail relationship between the Account and shoe objects will ensure that shoe records cannot exist without a related Account record, preventing them from becoming orphaned. 
Option A, creating an indirect lookup, is not relevant for this scenario as it is used to relate two objects indirectly through a shared object. 
Option B, creating an encrypted lookup, is also not relevant for this scenario as encryption is used to protect sensitive data and does not prevent orphaned records. 
Option C, creating a hierarchical lookup, is not relevant for this scenario as it is used to represent a hierarchical relationship between objects, such as a manager-employee relationship, and does not prevent orphaned records.

Cloud Kicks users are seeing error messages when they use one of their screen flows. The error messages are confusing but could be resolved if the users entered more information on the account before starting the flow. How should the administrator address this issues? 
Remove validation rules so that the users are able to process without complete records.
Create a permission set to allow users to bypass the error.
*Use a fault connector and display a screen with text explaining what went wrong and how to correct it.
Uncheck the end user Flow Errors box in setup.
Explanation: C is the correct answer for this question as it suggests using a fault connector and showing a screen with text that explains what went wrong and how to correct it. This approach helps to guide users to correct their input errors, thus resolving the issue with the screen flow. 
Option A (Removing validation rules) is not a recommended solution as it can lead to incomplete or inaccurate data entered by users. 
Option B (Creating a permission set to bypass the error) may not address the root cause of the error and could potentially lead to other issues. 
Option D (Unchecking the end user Flow Errors box) disables error notifications, which is not an effective resolution strategy, and users may continue to make the same mistakes.

The administrator at AW Computing wants to send off client welcome tasks and a welcome email to the primary contact automatically when an Opportunity is Closed won. What automation tool best accomplishes this? 
Validation Rule
Outbound Message
Approval Process
*Process Builder
Explanation: D is the correct answer because Process Builder is an automation tool in Salesforce that allows for the creation of complex, automated processes based on certain triggers or events, such as when an Opportunity is Closed won. With Process Builder, the administrator can set up an automation that automates the creation of client welcome tasks and sends a welcome email to the primary contact automatically.
A Validation Rule only triggers an error message when a record is being saved, based on conditions set by the administrator. It does not allow for the automatic creation of tasks or sending of emails.
An Outbound Message sends data to an external system based on specified criteria, but it does not allow for the automatic creation of tasks or sending of emails within Salesforce.
An Approval Process is used to automate the approval of a record based on a set of criteria but it does not allow for the automatic creation of tasks or sending of emails.

Universal Containers (UC) has a queue that is used for managing tasks that need to be worked by the UC customer support team. The same team will now be working some of UC's Cases. Which two options should the administrator use to help the support team? Choose 2 answers.  
*Configure a flow to assign the cases to the queue.
*Use assignment rules to set the queue as the owner of the case.
Add Case to the existing queue as available object.
Create a new queue and add Cases as an available object.
Explanation: A and B are the correct answers because they both involve assigning the cases to the existing queue that is already being used by the support team. Option A suggests configuring a flow that assigns the cases to the queue, while option B recommends using assignment rules to automatically set the queue as the owner of the case. 
Option C suggests adding Cases as an available object to the existing queue, which may not be necessary since the queue is already being used for managing tasks related to customer support. Option D recommends creating a new queue specifically for Cases, which could potentially create confusion for the support team and result in inefficient task management.

A new Sales Rep at Ursa Major has a qualified lead that is ready for conversion. When using the Lead Conversion process, which two records can be Created? Choose 2 answers.  
*Account
Campaign
Case
*Contact
Explanation: According to Salesforce Marketing Cloud's documentation, when using the Lead Conversion process, the Sales Rep can create two records: an Account and a Contact. This is because the lead may represent an individual, but the sales rep should also consider the company or organization that the individual works for (which would be captured in the Account record). The other options (Campaign and Case) may be related to the lead conversion process in some way, but they are not the two records that can be created through the process. Therefore, A and D are the correct answers for this question.

The administrator at Ursa Major Solar has Created a new record type for customer warranty cases. Which two assignments should the administrator use to display the new record type to users? Choose 2 answers.  
*Profile Assignment
Role Assignment
App Manager Assignment.
*Page layout Assignment.
Explanation: A is correct because Profile Assignment controls which profiles have access to the new record type. D is correct because Page layout Assignment controls which page layout the user sees when they access the new record type. B is incorrect because Role Assignment does not control access to record types. C is incorrect because App Manager Assignment controls access to apps, not record types.

Northern Trail Outfitters has asked an administrator to ensure that when a contact with a title of CEO is created, the contact's account record gets updated with the CEO's name. Which feature should an administrator use to implement this request? 
Quick Action
Workflow Rule
*Process Builder
Validation Rule
Explanation: C is the correct answer because the Process Builder is used to automate complex business processes in Salesforce. In this scenario, the administrator can create a process in the Process Builder that triggers when a contact with a title of CEO is created, and updates the CEO's name in the corresponding account record.
A quick action could be used to update a single field on a record, but it wouldn't be able to handle the complexity of this process. A workflow rule could also be used to update a field on the account record, but it wouldn't be able to update a field in response to a contact being created. A validation rule is used to prevent invalid data entry, and wouldn't be applicable for this scenario.

Ursa Major Solar wants to assist users with a guided expense report process to simplify submissions, routing, and authorizations. Which two tools should an administrator use to build this solution? Choose 2 answers.  
Validation Rule
*Flow Builder
*Approval Process
Quick Action
Explanation: B and C are the correct answers because both tools are specifically designed to automate and streamline business processes, such as expense report submissions, routing, and approvals. Validation Rules and Quick Actions are useful for enforcing data entry and performing quick record updates, respectively, but they do not offer the level of process automation and customization needed for a guided expense report process. Flow Builder allows administrators to create custom workflows and automate complex business processes, while Approval Processes provide a structured, customizable framework for managing approvals and routing.

The administrator at Ursa Major Solar imported records into an object by mistake. Which two tools should be used to undo this import? Choose 2 answers.  
Weekly Data Export
*Mass Delete Records
*Data Loader
Data Import Wizard
Explanation: B and C are the correct answers because:
- Mass Delete Records allows the administrator to delete multiple records at once, which can be used to undo the import of records into an object.
- Data Loader is a powerful tool used to insert, update, and delete large volumes of records, and it can also be used to undo the import of records into an object.
A and D are incorrect because:
- Weekly Data Export is a tool used to export data from Salesforce on a regular basis, and it cannot be used to undo an import of records into an object.
- Data Import Wizard is a tool used to import data into Salesforce, and it cannot be used to undo an import of records into an object.

Cloud Kicks wants to update a screen flow so that if the checkbox field High Value Customer is set to true, the first screen is skipped and the user is directed to the second screen. How should the administrator configure the decision element? 
*Use the equals operator and {!$GlobalConstant.True} as the value.
Use the equals operator and ''High Value Customer'' as the value.
Use the contains operator and {!$GlobalConstant.False} as the value.
Use the contains operator and ''High Value Customer'' as the value
Explanation: A is the correct answer because the decision element needs to check if the High Value Customer checkbox field is set to true, so the equals operator should be used. {!$GlobalConstant.True} should be used as the value to check for true. Option B is incorrect because it uses the field label as the value instead of the true/false value of the field. Options C and D are incorrect because they use the contains operator instead of the equals operator, which is not necessary for checking a true/false value. Additionally, option C uses {!$GlobalConstant.False} as the value, which is the opposite of what needs to be checked.

The administrator for Cloud Kicks needs to give access to a new custom object with custom fields to more than one user. Which two options should an administrator use to meet this requirement? Choose 2 answers.  
Add to manual sharing list
*Assign permission set group to Users
*Create a Permission Set
Edit organization-wide defaults
Explanation: B and C are the correct answers. According to Salesforce's documentation, assigning a permission set group to users and creating a permission set are both ways to grant access to specific objects and fields for multiple users at once. Adding to manual sharing lists would only give access to specific individual users, and editing organization-wide defaults could potentially give too much access or not enough access to the custom object and fields. Therefore, B and C are the most appropriate options for this requirement.

Universal Containers has enabled Data Protection and Privacy for its org. Which page layouts will have the Individual field available for tracking data privacy information? 
Case and Opportunity
Account and User
*Contact, Lead, and Person Account
Individual, User, and Account
Explanation: The correct answer is C because Contact, Lead, and Person Account are standard objects that store personal information of individuals, and therefore Data Protection and Privacy fields are available on these page layouts for tracking data privacy information. Options A and B, i.e., Case and Opportunity, and Account and User, respectively, do not store personal data, and therefore do not have Data Protection and Privacy fields available. Option D, i.e., Individual, User, and Account, is incorrect because there is no standard object named Individual in Salesforce, and hence, no page layout for Individual exists.

An analytics user at Cloud Kicks needs Read, Create, and Edit access for objects and should be restricted from deleting any records. What should the administrator do to meet this requirement? 
Assign the standard System Administrator profile to the analytical user.
Give the user View all access and assign them to the highest role in the role hierarchy.
*Create and assign a custom profile with Delete access removed for each object.
Create and assign a permission set that includes Read, Create, and Edit access
Explanation: The correct answer is C because it specifically addresses the requirement of restricting the user from deleting any records, which option A and B do not address. Option D may provide the necessary access, but it does not address the requirement of restricting the user from deleting records. Therefore, creating a custom profile with Delete access removed for each object is the most appropriate solution.

Cloud Kicks has a team of product owners that need a space to share feedback and ideas with just the product team. How should the administrator leverage Salesforce to help the team collaborate? 
Use Quick Actions to log communication.
Configure a Chatter Public Group.
*Create a Chatter Private Group.
Add Activity History to document tasks.
Explanation: The correct answer is C: Create a Chatter Private Group. 
This is because a private group is preferable when the team needs to share feedback and ideas confidentially, only with the product team. The private group will ensure that only the members of the product team can view and comment on the posts. 
Option A, using Quick Actions, is more appropriate for logging communication between individual users or to update a record. 
Option B, creating a Chatter Public Group, is not ideal in this scenario as it will allow anyone in the organization to view and comment on posts, which could lead to confidential information being exposed. 
Option D, adding Activity History to document tasks, is useful for tracking completed work, but it is not well-suited for collaborative communication among a team.

Northern Trail Outfitters uses a custom object Invoice to collect customer payment information from an external billing system. The Billing System field needs to be filled on every Invoice record. How should an administrator ensure this requirement? 
*Make the field universally required.
Create a Process Builder to set the field.
Define an approval process for the child.
Require the field on the record type.
Explanation: A.Making a field universally required is a way to ensure that the field needs to be filled on every record; it prevents users from saving a record without entering a value in that field. It can be used to ensure that the billing system field needs to be filled on every invoice record by making it universally required in the field settings. Creating a process builder to set the field, defining an approval process for the child, or requiring the field on the record type are not ways to ensure that the field needs to be filled on every record; they either do not enforce data entry or only apply to certain scenarios or users. References: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.customize_fields.htm &amp;type=5

Cloud Kicks has a custom object called Shipments. The Company wants to see all the shipment items from an Account page. When an Account is deleted, the shipments should remain. What type of relationship should the administrator make between Shipments and Account? 
*Shipments should have a lookup to Account.
Accounts should have a lookup to Shipments.
Shipments should have a master-detail to Accounts.
Accounts should have a master-detail to Shipments.
Explanation: Based on the requirement that the shipments should remain even when an account is deleted, the appropriate relationship type between the Shipments and Account objects would be a lookup relationship.
Therefore, the administrator should choose option A: Shipments should have a lookup to Account. This allows each shipment record to be associated with a specific account but does not enforce a dependency where the shipments are deleted when the account is deleted.
Using a master-detail relationship (options C and D) would create a dependency between the two objects, where deleting the account would also delete the associated shipments. This is not in line with the requirement mentioned.
Option B, where Accounts have a lookup to Shipments, would not allow for a direct relationship between shipments and accounts.

A sales rep at Ursa Major Solar has launched a series of networking events. They are hosting one event per month and want to be able to report on campaign ROI by month and series. How should the administrator set up the Campaign to simplify reporting? 
Add different record types for the monthly event types.
Create individual Campaigns that all have the same name.
Configure campaign Member Statuses to record which event members attended.
*Use Campaign Hierarchy where the monthly events roll up to a parent Campaign
Explanation: The correct answer is D because using Campaign Hierarchy allows for the monthly events to roll up to a parent Campaign. This makes it easier to report on campaign ROI by month and series. Answer A is incorrect because adding different record types for the monthly event types does not simplify reporting. Answer B is incorrect because creating individual Campaigns with the same name does not allow for easy reporting on ROI by month and series. Answer C is incorrect because configuring campaign Member Statuses to record which event members attended does not address the need to report on ROI by month and series.

Ursa Major Solar offers amazing experiences for all of it employees. The Employee engagement committee wants to post updates while restricting other employees from posting. What should the administrator create to meet this request? 
Chatter Stream.
*Chatter Broadcast Group
Chatter Recommendations.
Chatter Unlisted Group
Explanation: B is the correct answer because a Chatter Broadcast Group allows for one-way messaging from selected members to a large group of followers. In this case, the Employee engagement committee can post updates to the group while restricting other employees from posting. A Chatter Stream and Chatter Recommendations are not relevant to this specific request, and a Chatter Unlisted Group still allows any member to post, defeating the purpose of restricting other employees from posting.

The sales manager at Cloud Kicks approves time off for their employees. They asked the administrator to ensure these requests are seen and responded to by a backup manager while the sales manager is out on vacation. What should administrator use to fulfill the requirement? 
*Delegated approver
Two step Approval process
Approval history related list
Delegated Administrator
Explanation: The correct answer is A, Delegated approver. According to Salesforce Marketing Cloud's documentation, Delegated approvers allow an administrator to assign another person as an approver for a specific user, group or role for a specified period of time. This fulfills the requirement of ensuring that backup manager can see and respond to time off requests while the sales manager is out on vacation. 
B, Two step Approval process, is not the best solution as it involves creating a multi-step approval process, which may not be necessary for this particular situation.
C, Approval history related list, is also not the best solution as it only displays the history of approvals and does not allow for the assignment of a backup manager.
D, Delegated Administrator, is not the best solution as it would give the assigned person full access to the organization's Salesforce Marketing Cloud account, which is not necessary for fulfilling this requirement.

Northern Trail Outfitters has a new flow that automatically sets the field values when a new account is created. The flow is launched by a process, but the flow is not working properly. What should administrator do to identify the problem? 
*Use the native debug feature in the flow builder.
Review debug logs with the login level.
View the setup audit Trail and review for errors.
Setup Email logs and review the send error log.
Explanation: The correct answer is A. Use the native debug feature in the flow builder.
Salesforce Marketing Cloud's documentation suggests using the native debug feature in the flow builder to identify the problem because it allows the administrator to track the execution of the flow and pinpoint where the flow is failing. This feature displays the values of variables and elements in the flow, and it shows where the flow stopped. This step-by-step approach can help the administrator identify the problem and troubleshoot it. 
Answers B, C, and D are incorrect because they are not relevant to debugging flows in Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Reviewing debug logs with the login level or viewing the setup audit Trail may help identify other types of errors, but they will not provide specific information on where the flow is failing. Setting up email logs is only relevant if the issue is related to email sending, which is not mentioned in the question.

Cloud Kicks want to give credit to Opportunity team members based on the level of effort contributed by each person toward each deal. What feature should the administrator use to meet this requirement? 
Stages
*Splits
Queues
List Views
Explanation: B is the correct answer because Splits in Salesforce Marketing Cloud allow for the division of a record or message based on certain criteria, such as level of effort contributed by each team member towards a particular deal. This can be used to distribute credit or allocate tasks accordingly. 
A is incorrect because Stages refer to the different stages of a sales process and do not necessarily take into account individual effort. 
C is incorrect because Queues are used for distributing tasks to specific teams or individuals, but do not take into account individual effort or credit. 
D is incorrect because List Views are used to manage and view sets of records, but do not have any functionality for dividing credit or tasks based on individual effort.

When a Cloud Kicks Opportunity closes, the company would like to automatically create a renewal opportunity. Which two automation tools should an administrator use to accomplish this request? Choose 2 answers.  
Approval Process
*Flow Builder
WorkFlow Rule
*Process Builder
Explanation: B and D are the correct answers because Flow Builder and Process Builder are automation tools that allow an administrator to create automation events based on certain triggers, such as when an Opportunity closes. Both tools are capable of creating a renewal Opportunity automatically, but they have different capabilities and use cases depending on the specific scenario. Approval Process and Workflow Rule are also automation tools, but they are not the most appropriate tools for this task because they are designed for other purposes, such as routing records or approving changes. Therefore, A and C are incorrect answers.

The administrator at Aw Computing wants Account Details, related list and chatter feeds to each appear on separate tabs when reviewing an account. Which type of page should the administrator create? 
Lightning app page.
Lightning page Tab.
*Lightning record page.
Lightning page Component.
Explanation: The correct answer is C. Lightning record page. 
According to Salesforce's documentation, a Lightning record page is used to display the details of a specific record, such as an account. The page can be customized to display various components, including related lists and chatter feeds. Additionally, a Lightning record page can be broken up into different sections or tabs for easier navigation. 
Option A, a Lightning app page, is used to create a custom app within Salesforce. Option B, a Lightning page tab, is used to create a tab for a custom Lightning page. Option D, a Lightning page component, is used to create a reusable component that can be added to an existing Lightning page. None of these options specifically address the requirement of displaying account details, related lists, and chatter feeds on separate tabs within a record page.

Cloud Kicks has the organization wide defaults for Opportunity set to private. Which two features should the administrator use to open up access to Opportunity records for sales users working on collaborative deals? Choose 2 answers.  
Sharing set
*Role hierarchy
Profiles
*Sharing rules
Explanation: The correct answers are B (Role hierarchy) and D (Sharing rules). 
A (Sharing set) is used to extend sharing access to a particular set of users, not to open up access organization-wide. 
C (Profiles) determine the level of access a user has to an object, but do not affect the sharing settings for that object. 
B (Role hierarchy) can be used to grant access to records owned by subordinates to users with higher roles in the hierarchy. 
D (Sharing rules) can be used to expand access to records based on criteria such as record owner, record type, or fields on the record.

The VP of Sales at Cloud Kicks is receiving an error message that prevents them from saving an Opportunity. The administrator attempted the same edit without receiving an error. How can the administrator validate the error the user is receiving? 
Edit the page layout.
View the setup audit trail.
*Log in as the user
Review the sharing model
Explanation: The correct answer is C, "Log in as the user." This is because the administrator needs to experience the error firsthand to be able to validate it and troubleshoot it effectively. Editing the page layout or reviewing the sharing model would not necessarily help with identifying the specific error message the user is receiving. View the setup audit trail would provide a record of changes made to the organization, but would not necessarily help with addressing the user's specific issue.

Cloud Kicks wants to track shoe designs by products. Shoe designs should be unable to be deleted, and there can be multiple designs for one product across various stages. Which two steps should the administration configure to meet this requirement? Choose 2 answers.  
*Create a Custom Object for shoe design.
Configure a Custom Lookup Field for shoe design on the product object.
*Add a custom master detail field for shoe design on the Product Object.
Use the Standard Object for designs.
Explanation: A is correct because creating a custom object for shoe design will allow Cloud Kicks to track shoe designs as a separate, distinct entity from products. This will allow them to enforce the requirement that shoe designs cannot be deleted.
C is correct because adding a custom master-detail field for shoe design on the product object will allow Cloud Kicks to link shoe designs to their respective products. This will allow them to track multiple designs for one product across various stages.
B is incorrect because a custom lookup field would not enforce the requirement that shoe designs cannot be deleted, nor would it allow Cloud Kicks to track multiple designs for one product across various stages.
D is incorrect because there is no standard object for designs in Salesforce.

The administrator at Cloud Kicks updated the custom object Event to include a lookup field to the primary contact for the event. When running an event report, they want to reference fields from the associated contact record. What should the administrator do to pull contact fields into the Custom report? 
Configure formula fields on event to populate contact information
*Edit the custom Event report type and add fields related via lookup.
Create a new report type with event as the primary object and Contact as a related object.
Use a dashboard with filters to show Event and Contact data as requested.
Explanation: Option B is the correct answer because it suggests editing the custom Event report type and adding fields related via lookup. This is the correct approach because lookup fields allow the administrator to reference fields from the associated contact record, which is what they want to do in this scenario. Options A, C, and D do not address the need to reference fields from the associated contact record and therefore are incorrect. Configuring formula fields may not be a viable solution as it requires creating a formula for each field that needs to be referenced. Creating a new report type with Event as the primary object and Contact as a related object would be unnecessary as the lookup field already provides the necessary association between the two objects. Using a dashboard with filters would not be efficient in this case as it may require creating multiple dashboards to display all the necessary data.

Cloud Kicks wants to have consistency when communicating with customers on cases. The company has requested messages to be sent in an email channel with categories to help search for the proper message. Which Solution Should the administrator suggest to meet this requirement? 
Prebuilt Quick Texts
*Prebuilt Email Templates.
Prebuilt Flow Templates.
Prebuilt Auto-Responses.
Explanation: The correct answer is B, Prebuilt Email Templates. Salesforce's documentation states that email templates can be used to ensure consistency in communication with customers on cases. These templates can be prebuilt with categories to help search for the proper message. Option A, Prebuilt Quick Texts, are for short, frequently-used messages and may not provide the necessary categories for searching. Option C, Prebuilt Flow Templates, are used for automating business processes and may not be necessary for this specific requirement. Option D, Prebuilt Auto-Responses, are for automated responses to certain events or actions and may not address the need for consistency in communication with customers on cases.

Sales Users at Cloud Kicks are requesting that the data in the industry field on the Account object displays on the Opportunity page layout. Which type of the field should an administrator create to accomplish this? 
Custom Account Field
Standard Account Field.
*Cross Object Formula Field
Master detail relationship Field
Explanation: The correct answer is C: Cross Object Formula Field. This is because the data in the industry field on the Account object is required to be displayed on the Opportunity page layout. In order to display data from one object to another, a cross-object formula field must be created. This field allows administrators to include data from a related object on a record. The other options, including Custom Account Field, Standard Account Field, and Master detail relationship Field, do not provide a solution for displaying data from one object to another.

An administrator has been asked to change the data type of an auto number to text field. What should the administrator be aware of before changing the field? 
*Existing field values will remain unchanged.
Existing field values will be Converted.
Existing field values will be deleted.
Existing auto number field to Text is prevented.
Explanation: According to Salesforce Marketing Cloud's documentation, option A is the correct answer because changing the data type of an auto number to a text field will not affect the existing field values. The auto number values will still remain the same, but will now be displayed as text. Options B and C are incorrect because they imply that the existing field values will either be converted or deleted, which is not the case. Option D is also incorrect because it suggests that changing an auto number field to text is prevented, which is not true. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.notes_on_changing_custom_field_types.htm&amp;type=5

An administrator at Cloud Kicks wants to deactivate a User who has left the company. What are two reasons that would prevent a user from being deactivated? Choose 2 answers.  
The use is part of a territory hierarchy.
*The User is in a Custom hierarchy field.
*The User is assigned in workflow email alert.
The User is the highest role in the role hierarchy
Explanation: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.users_deactivate_considerations.htm&amp;type=5

An administrator at Dreamhouse Reality needs to Create Customized pages for the salesforce mobile app. Which two types of pages could an administrator build and customize using the Lightning App Builder? Choose 2 answers.  
User Page
Dashboard page
*App page
*Record Page
Explanation: The correct answers are C and D because according to Salesforce Marketing Cloud's documentation, Lightning App Builder is used to customize App pages and Record pages for the Salesforce mobile app. User pages and Dashboard pages are not customizable using the Lightning App Builder. Therefore, options A and B are incorrect. https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/lightning_app_builder/lightning_app_builder_intro

Users at Dreamhouse Reality are only allowed to see opportunities they own. Leadership wants an enterprise-wide dashboard of all open opportunities in the pipeline so that users can see how the company is performing at any point in time. How should an administrator create the dashboard without changing any sharing setting? 
Update the dashboard to folder settings to manager for the sales reps role.
Add a filter to the dashboard to filter the opportunities by owner role.
Build individual dashboards for profiles that need to see the enterprise results.
*Create a dashboard with the running User set as someone who can see all Opportunities
Explanation: The correct answer is D because creating a dashboard with the running User set as someone who can see all Opportunities will allow users to see all open opportunities in the pipeline without changing any sharing settings. Option A is not relevant to the question and will not solve the problem. Option B may limit the visibility of opportunities based on owner role, which is not what the question is asking. Option C will require building individual dashboards, which is not an efficient solution for an enterprise-wide dashboard.

The administrator at Ursa Major Solar has been asked to change the work Item and Project Custom Object Relationship from a master detail to a Lookup. Which Scenario Could prevent the administrator from fulfilling this requirement? 
A junction object is required to support the lookup.
The lookup field in all the records contains a value.
The Look-Up field is required for Saving Records.
*Roll-Up summary field exists on the master object.
Explanation: D is the correct answer because changing the relationship from master-detail to lookup will break any roll-up summary fields that exist on the master object. Roll-up summary fields are only available in master-detail relationships, so changing the relationship type would cause them to become invalid. The other options, A, B, and C, do not prevent the administrator from fulfilling the requirement to change the relationship type. Option A suggests that a junction object may be needed, but it does not prevent the change. Option B states that the lookup field contains a value, which is not a barrier to changing the relationship type. Option C notes that the lookup field is required for saving records, which is also not a barrier to changing the relationship type.

The administrator at Cloud Kicks created a new field for tracking returns on their new cloud shoe. A user has submitted a case to the administrator indicating that the new field is unavailable. Which two steps should an administrator do to troubleshoot this issue? Choose 2 answers.  
*Ensure that the page layout for the user's profile has been updated.
Run the setup audit trail for the organization.
Update the organization wide default for the object.
*Review the field level security of the field for the user profile
Explanation: A is correct because the issue may be that the user's profile does not have access to the new field on the page layout. By ensuring that the page layout has been updated, the administrator can verify that the user can see the new field.
D is also correct because the issue may be related to field level security, which controls access to individual fields on a record. By reviewing the field level security of the field for the user profile, the administrator can ensure that the user has access to the new field.
B and C are incorrect because they are not relevant to the issue of the new field being unavailable to the user. The setup audit trail would show changes made to the organization's configuration and would not specifically help with this issue. Updating the organization-wide default for the object would not affect the availability of the new field for the user profile.

The marketing director at Northern Trail Outfitters has requested that the budget field is populated in order for the Lead Status field to be marked as qualified. What tool should the administrator use to fulfill this request? 
Lead Conversion.
Require Field.
Workflow Rule
*Validation Rule
Explanation: D is the correct answer because using a validation rule will ensure that the budget field is populated before the lead status is marked as qualified, thus ensuring data accuracy and consistency. Lead conversion (A) is used to turn a lead into a contact or account, and does not relate to populating fields. Require field (B) only requires a field to be filled out before a record can be saved, but does not necessarily enforce a specific relationship or requirement between fields. Workflow rule (C) can automate certain actions or updates based on specified criteria, but does not directly enforce or validate data input.

Cloud Kicks has a Customer success agent going on leave and needs to change ownership on multiple cases. Which two users are able to fulfill this request? Choose 2 answers.  
A user with Read Permission on account.
A user with manager role above the agent.
*A user with the System Administrator profile.
*A user with the Manage Cases Permission
Explanation: The correct answer is C and D because a user with the System Administrator profile has access to all objects and settings in the organization, including the ability to change ownership on cases. A user with the Manage Cases Permission has the ability to create, edit, and delete cases, including changing case ownership. Option A, a user with Read Permission on account, does not have the necessary permissions to change ownership on cases. Option B, a user with a manager role above the agent, may have some access to the agent's cases but may not have the necessary permissions to change ownership on all cases.

The marketing team at Ursa Major Solar wants to send a personalized email whenever a lead fills out the web-to-Lead form on their website. They want to send different Message based on the Lead Industry Field Value. What Should an administrator configure to meet this requirement? 
Use Validation rule to trigger workflow to email to Lead.
*Configure an auto response rule to email the lead.
Add a public group and process builder to email the lead.
Create an assignment rule to email the lead
Explanation: B is the correct answer because an auto response rule allows for personalized email content and can be configured to be triggered by a web-to-lead form submission. Additionally, an auto response rule can be set up to send different messages based on the Lead Industry Field Value, which meets the requirement stated in the question. 
Option A is incorrect because a validation rule ensures data entered into a record meets specific criteria but does not trigger an email. 
Option C is incorrect because adding a public group and process builder does not address the requirement to send a personalized email based on the Lead Industry Field Value.
Option D is incorrect because an assignment rule determines how leads are assigned to users or queues, but does not address the requirement to send a personalized email based on the Lead Industry Field Value.

Cloud Kicks (CK) has a new administrator who is asked to put together a memo detailing salesforce uses to budget for upcoming license purchases. Where should the administrator go to find out what type of licenses CK Has purchased and how many are available? Choose 1.  
Search for licenses types in setup.
*User Licenses Related List in Company information.
User Management settings in setup.
Usage based entitlement related list in company information.
Explanation: The correct answer is B. According to Salesforce Marketing Cloud's documentation, the User Licenses Related List in Company Information displays the total number of licenses purchased for the organization and the number of available licenses. Option A is incorrect because searching for license types in setup will only show the available license types and not the number of licenses purchased. Option C is also incorrect because User Management settings in setup allow the administrator to manage users and their permissions, but not to view the number of licenses purchased. Option D is incorrect because the Usage based entitlement related list in company information shows the usage of licenses and entitlements, but not the number of licenses purchased or available.

Sales reps miss key fields when filling out an opportunity record through the sales process. Reps need to move forward in stages but are unable to enter a previous stage. Which three options should the administrator use to address this need? Choose 3 answers.  
Enable guided selling.
*Use Validation Rules.
*Configure Opportunity Path.
Use Flow to mark fields required.
*Mark fields required on the page layout.
Explanation: B is correct because using validation rules would ensure that key fields are not left blank and the sales reps cannot move forward in the sales process without filling out those required fields.
C is correct because configuring the Opportunity Path would allow the sales reps to move forward in stages but also require them to fill out the necessary fields before being able to move on to the next stage.
E is correct because marking fields as required on the page layout would prompt the sales reps to fill out those fields before being able to move forward in the sales process.
A is incorrect because enabling guided selling would not necessarily address the issue of missing key fields.
D is incorrect because using Flow to mark fields required would be redundant and unnecessary when the same thing can be achieved by marking the fields required on the page layout.

Ursa Major Solar has a path on Case. The Company wants to require its users to follow the status values as they are on the path. Agents should be prohibited from preventing the case back to a previous status. Which Feature Should an administrator use to fulfill this request? 
*Validation rules.
Global Value Picklists
Predefined field Values.
Dependent Picklists.
Explanation: A is the correct answer because validation rules allow an administrator to define specific rules and criteria that must be met before a record can be saved, which includes preventing a case from being moved back to a previous status. Global Value Picklists and Dependent Picklists are used to restrict values that can be entered into specific fields, but they do not enforce the order or restrictions on the status values. Predefined field values are used to pre-populate fields but do not provide any enforcement or restriction on the status values.

Northern Trail Outfitters wants to know the average stage duration for all closed Opportunities. How should an administrator support this request? Choose 1. 
Use process builder to capture the daily average on each opportunity.
Add Formula Fields to track Stages on each Opportunity.
*Run the Opportunity Stage Duration report.
Refresh weekly reporting snapshots for Closed Opportunities.
Explanation: The correct answer is C, Run the Opportunity Stage Duration report. This is because the report is specifically designed to show the stage duration for closed opportunities. Option A is incorrect because it would only capture the daily average and would not provide an overall average for all closed opportunities. Option B is incorrect because it would only track the stages and not the duration of each stage. Option D is also incorrect because it would not provide the necessary information on stage duration for closed opportunities.

Universal Container wants to increase the security of their org by requiring stricker user passwords. Which two of the following should an administrator configure? Choose 2 answers.  
Password different then username
Prevent common words
*Minimum password length.
*Password complexity requirement.
Explanation: The correct answers are C and D because they relate to configuring the strength and complexity of user passwords. Option A, requiring a password different from the username, is generally considered a basic security measure and is often already enforced by default. Option B, preventing common words, is also a good security practice, but it alone does not increase the strength or complexity of passwords. Therefore, options A and B are not the most appropriate answers to the question.

Sales reps at Cloud Kicks want to be notified when they have a high likelihood of winning an opportunity over $1,000,000. Which feature meets this requirement? 
Key Deals
*Big Deal Alerts
Activity Timeline.
Performance chart.
Explanation: The correct answer is B. Big Deal Alerts. This feature in Salesforce Marketing Cloud allows sales reps to receive notifications when there is a high likelihood of winning an opportunity with a certain threshold (in this case, over $1,000,000). Option A, Key Deals, is a feature that allows users to prioritize and track important opportunities, but it does not provide notifications based on likelihood of winning. Option C, Activity Timeline, is a feature that displays a chronological view of a lead or contact's activities, but it does not provide notifications for deal opportunities. Option D, Performance chart, is a feature that displays performance metrics but it does not provide notifications or alerts for deal opportunities. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Big Deal Alerts.

Northern Trail Outfitters wants emails received from customers to generate cases automatically. How should the administrator ensure that the emails are sent to the correct queue? 
Utilize a flow to identify the correct queue and assign the case.
Use a custom email services to set the owner of the case upon creation.
Create an Escalation Rules to send cases to the correct queue.
*Configure Email-to-Case so emails are delivered to the correct queue
Explanation: D is the correct answer because Email-to-Case is designed to automatically create cases from incoming emails and route them to the correct queue based on the configured routing addresses. This ensures that emails received from customers will generate cases automatically and be sent to the correct queue without manual intervention. 
Option A, utilizing a flow, can be used to assign cases to a queue but it doesn't ensure that emails received from customers will generate cases automatically. 
Option B, using a custom email service, can be used to set the owner of the case upon creation but it doesn't ensure that emails received from customers will generate cases automatically and be sent to the correct queue. 
Option C, creating escalation rules, can be used to escalate cases based on certain criteria but it doesn't ensure that the emails are sent to the correct queue.

An administrator at Cloud Kicks needs to export a file of closed won opportunities from the last 90 days. The file should include the Opportunity Name, ID, Close Date, and Amount. How should the administrator export this file? 
Data Export Wizard.
Data Import Wizard.
*Data Loader.
Explanation: C is the correct answer because the Data Loader is a more flexible tool and can easily export records based on custom criteria. Additionally, it can export larger quantities of records than the Data Export Wizard. The Data Import Wizard is used for importing data into Salesforce, not exporting. Therefore, B is incorrect. While the Data Export Wizard can export records, it has more limited options for customizing the export criteria and can only export up to 50,000 records, making it less suitable for large data exports. Therefore, A is also incorrect.

Universal Containers has two sales teams, Sales team A and Sales team B. Each team has their own role in the role hierarchy. Both roles are subordinates of the same Manager role. How should the administrator share records owned by sales team A with Sales team B? 
Hierarchical sharing
*Use Manual sharing
Criteria based sharing
Owner based sharing
Explanation: Manual sharing allows record owners to share individual records with other users or groups. This is useful when one-off sharing is needed for a specific situation. Hierarchical sharing, criteria-based sharing and owner-based sharing are not suitable for this scenario because they are based on predefined rules or roles that do not match the requirement.

Cloud Kicks has created a screen flow for their sales team to use when they add new leads. The screen flow collect name, email and shoe preference. Which two things should the administrator do to display the screen flow? Choose 2 answers.  
*Create a tab and add the screen flow to the page.
*Use a flow element and add the screen flow to the record page.
Add the flow in the utility bar of the console
Install an app from the AppExchange
Explanation: According to Salesforce Marketing Cloud's documentation, options A and B are correct because:
A. Creating a tab and adding the screen flow to the page allows the sales team to access and use the screen flow easily. 
B. Using a flow element and adding the screen flow to the record page allows the sales team to access and use the screen flow while they are working on a specific record. 
C. Adding the flow in the utility bar of the console is incorrect because this option is only applicable for Salesforce Console users. 
D. Installing an app from the AppExchange is also incorrect because there is no indication that an app is needed to display the screen flow.

Universal Containers (UC) customers have provided feedback that their support cases are not being responded to quickly enough. UC wants to send all unassigned Cases that have been open for more than 2 hours to an urgent Case queue and alert the support manager. Which feature should an administrator configure to meet this requirement? 
Case Scheduled Reports.
Case Dashboard Refreshes.
*Case Escalation Rules.
Case Assignment Rules.
Explanation: C is the correct answer because Case Escalation Rules can be configured to automatically escalate cases that meet certain criteria, such as being open for more than a certain amount of time. In this scenario, UC wants to escalate unassigned cases that have been open for more than 2 hours to an urgent Case queue and alert the support manager. Case Scheduled Reports and Case Dashboard Refreshes are not relevant to this requirement. Case Assignment Rules are used to assign cases to specific individuals or teams based on certain criteria, and do not address the issue of cases not being responded to quickly enough.

Users at Cloud Kicks want to see information more useful for their role on the Case page. How should an administrator make the pages more dynamic and easier to use? 
*Add Component visibility filters to the Components.
Remove fields from the record details component.
Delete the extra component from the page.
Include more tab components with filters.
Explanation: A is the correct answer because adding component visibility filters will allow the administrator to customize the display of components on the Case page based on user roles or other criteria. This makes the page more dynamic and tailored to the user's needs. 
B is incorrect because removing fields from the record details component may actually make the page less useful for the user's role, as they might need access to all the information displayed. 
C is incorrect because deleting a component from the page does not necessarily make it more dynamic and easier to use. 
D is incorrect because including more tab components with filters does not necessarily make the page more dynamic and easier to use, as it could potentially clutter the page and make it harder to navigate.

Ursa Major Solar uses two different page layouts for Account records. One page layout reflects the fields related to customer accounts and another page layout includes fields for partner accounts. The administrator has assigned the customer account page layout to sales and support users and the partner account layout to the partner management team. What should the administrator configure to meet this requirement? 
Use a public group and a criteria-based sharing rule to share customer accounts with the partner team.
Add members of the partner management team to the default Account team for the customer accounts.
Grant create, read, edit and delete access to customer accounts on the partner team profile.
*Create one record type for customer accounts and one record type for partner accounts.
Explanation: The correct answer is D because creating different record types for customer accounts and partner accounts will allow the administrator to assign different page layouts to each record type. This means that the customer account page layout can be assigned to sales and support users while the partner account page layout can be assigned to the partner management team. 
The other options are incorrect because: 
A. Using a public group and criteria-based sharing rule would grant access to customer accounts to the partner team, but it would not allow for different page layouts to be assigned to each group. 
B. Adding members of the partner management team to the default Account team for customer accounts would give them access to the same page layout as sales and support users, which is not what is desired. 
C. Granting access to customer accounts on the partner team profile would not allow for different page layouts to be assigned to each group.

Ursa Major Solar wants to know which of its marketing efforts are helping the team win Opportunities. What should an administrator configure to provide these insights? 
Campaign Hierarchy.
*Campaign Influence
Map Custom Lead Fields
List Email Activities
Explanation: B is the correct answer because Campaign Influence is a feature in Salesforce that helps to understand which marketing campaigns or channels have influenced an Opportunity. By configuring Campaign Influence, an administrator can determine the credit percentage of marketing campaigns that influenced the Opportunity, giving insight into which marketing efforts are most effective. 
A is incorrect because Campaign Hierarchy is a different feature altogether which lets you organize your marketing campaigns by nesting campaigns within each other. It does not provide insights into which campaigns are driving Opportunities. 
C is incorrect because Mapping custom lead fields is a way to capture specific information within a lead record, it doesn't provide any insights into which marketing campaigns are driving Opportunities. 
D is incorrect because while List Email Activities can provide some insights into email open rates, click-through rates, and other engagement metrics, it doesn't provide insights into which marketing efforts are driving Opportunities.

Which item is available in a Lightning App where visibility is limited to the Salesforce Mobile App? Choose 1.  
Today
Favorites
*Utility Bar.
Home Page.
Explanation: According to Salesforce Marketing Cloud's documentation, the correct answer is C. Utility Bar. The utility bar is a feature that appears on the bottom of the Salesforce Mobile app screen and provides quick access to important tools and features, such as creating a new record or accessing a knowledge article. Options A and B, Today and Favorites, are not specific to the mobile app and can be accessed in other Salesforce interfaces. Option D, Home Page, may be available on the mobile app, but its visibility is not limited to the mobile app only, as it can also be accessed on desktop interfaces. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.limits_mobile_sf1_nav_and_actions.htm&amp;type=5

An administrator supporting a global team of salesforce users has been asked to configure company settings. Choose 2 options. 
*Currency Locale
*Default Language
Password Policy
Login Hours
Explanation: A and B are the correct answers because they relate specifically to global settings that can impact the user experience for a broad range of users. Currency Locale will ensure that the correct monetary symbols and formats are used across different regions, while Default Language can ensure that all users can understand system messages and instructions. In contrast, Password Policy and Login Hours are more specific to security and user management, and may not have as wide of an impact on users across different regions.

A team of support users at Cloud Kicks is helping inside sales reps make follow-up calls to prospects that filled out an interest form online. The team currently does not have access to the lead object. How should an administrator provide proper access? 
Create a new profile
*Configure permission sets.
Assign a new role.
Set Up Manual Sharing
Explanation: The correct answer is B. Configure permission sets. According to Salesforce Marketing Cloud's documentation, permission sets are used to grant additional permissions to users or groups without changing their profiles. In this scenario, the team of support users at Cloud Kicks needs access to the lead object without changing their profiles, which can be accomplished through assigning a permission set with the necessary access. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they do not specifically address the need for providing access to the lead object without changing the users' profiles.

An administrator creates a custom text area field on the Account object and adds it to the service team's page layout. The services team manager loves the addition of this field and wants it to appear in the highlights panel so that the services reps can quickly find it when on the Account Page. How should the administrator accomplish this? 
Create a new page layout and a new section titled highlights panel.
In the Account object manager, create a custom compact layout.
*From the page layout editor, drag the field to the highlights panel.
Make the field required and move it to the top of the page.
Explanation: C is the correct answer because the question specifically asks how to add the custom text area field to the highlights panel on the Account Page. The most appropriate way to achieve this is to use the page layout editor and drag the field to the highlights panel. 
A is incorrect because creating a new page layout and a new highlights panel section is not necessary to accomplish this task.
B is incorrect because creating a custom compact layout is not the most appropriate solution to add a field to the highlights panel.
D is incorrect because making the field required and moving it to the top of the page does not address the specific request to add the field to the highlights panel.

An Administrator wants to trigger a follow-up task for the opportunity owner when they close an opportunity as won and another task after 60 days to check in with the customer. Which two automation tools should the administrator use? Choose 2 answers.  
*Process builder
*Workflow Rule
Field Update
Outbound Message
Explanation: A and B are the correct answers because they are both automation tools that can be used to trigger follow-up tasks. Process Builder allows for the creation of complex automation flows with multiple actions and criteria, while Workflow Rules can be simpler and more straightforward. Field Update is used to update a field value on a record, while Outbound Message is used to send a message to an external system. Neither of these options would be appropriate for triggering follow-up tasks in this scenario.

Northern Trail Outfitters has the Case Object set to private. The support manager raised a concern the reps have a boarder view of data than expected and can see all cases on their groups dashboards. What could be causing reps to have inappropriate access to data on dashboards? 
Dashboard Filters
Dashboard Subscriptions
*Dynamic Dashboards
Public Dashboards.
Explanation: C is the correct answer because dynamic dashboards allow users to see data based on their assigned roles and permissions, but if the underlying data is not properly secured, users may be able to see data they should not have access to. In this case, although the Case Object is set to private, the dynamic dashboard may be allowing reps to see cases outside of their assigned groups. 
A is incorrect because dashboard filters allow users to narrow down the data they see on a dashboard, but they cannot override the underlying data security settings. 
B is incorrect because dashboard subscriptions only allow users to receive regular updates on a specific dashboard, but again, they cannot override the underlying data security settings. 
D is incorrect because public dashboards are open to all users and do not have any data security restrictions, but in this scenario, the Case Object is set to private.

An administrator at Ursa Major Solar needs to send information to an external accounting system. What workflow action should the administrator use to accomplish this? 
Assign Task
*Outbound Message
Create Record
Custom Notification
Explanation: B is the correct answer because Outbound Message is a workflow action in Salesforce Marketing Cloud that enables administrators to send automatically generated messages to external systems. This option is specifically designed for sending data to external systems, making it the most appropriate choice for the scenario presented in the question. 
Option A, Assign Task, is more suitable for tasks within Salesforce Marketing Cloud, rather than for communicating with external systems. Option C, Create Record, is also not a direct way to send data to external systems. Finally, Option D, Custom Notification, is used for sending notifications within Salesforce Marketing Cloud rather than passing data to external systems.

The administrator at Ursa Major Solar need to make sure the unassigned cases from VP customers get transferred to the appropriate service representative within 5 hours. VIP Customers have access to support 24 hours a day. How should this be configured? 
*Assignment Rules.
Business Hours.
Case Queues
Escalation Rules
Explanation: The correct answer is A, Assignment Rules. This is because Assignment Rules allow the administrator to automatically assign cases to the appropriate service representative based on criteria such as customer type or other fields. Business Hours and Escalation Rules do not address the need for specific case assignment. Case Queues could potentially be used, but it does not specify how the unassigned cases will be transferred to the appropriate representative within 5 hours.

Dreamhouse realty wants to offer a form on its experience cloud site where inspectors will submit findings from a property inspection. Which feature should an administrator place on the page to fulfill this requirement? 
Related List
Autolaunched Flow
*Record Detail
Screen Flow
Explanation: C is the correct answer because the Record Detail feature allows users to view and edit a specific record in detail, which is exactly what the inspectors will need to do when submitting their findings. The Related List feature displays related records, but it does not provide the necessary level of detail for this use case. Autolaunched and Screen Flows both involve automating a series of actions, which are not necessary for this requirement.

An administrator is on a tight deadline to create dashboards for the sales and marketing teams at AW Computing. What should the administrator do to meet the deadline without increasing the budget? 
Train someone on the sales and marketing teams to build dashboards.
*Check the AppExchange for prebuilt Solution that can be easily customized.
Hire a Consultant to build the custom dashboards.
Build the dashboards manually to meet the deadline.
Explanation: The correct answer is B: Check the AppExchange for prebuilt solutions that can be easily customized.
This is the most efficient and cost-effective solution for the administrator to meet the deadline without increasing the budget. The AppExchange offers a wide range of prebuilt solutions that can be easily customized and tailored to meet the specific needs of the sales and marketing teams at AW Computing. It saves time, effort and cost compared to building the dashboards manually or hiring a consultant to build custom dashboards. Training someone on the sales and marketing teams to build dashboards may not be the most efficient option as it requires time and resources. Hiring a consultant to build custom dashboards may be costly and may not meet the tight deadline.

DreamHouse Realty regularly processes customer requests for warranty work and would like to offer customers a self-serve option to generate cases. Which two solutions should an administrator use to meet this request? Choose 2 answers.  
*Web-to-Case
Case Escalation
*Case Queues
Email-to-Case
Explanation: The correct answers are A and C. 
According to Salesforce's documentation, Web-to-Case is a feature that allows customers to submit support cases directly through a company's website, which would meet the requirement of offering a self-serve option for customers to generate cases. 
Case Queues are a way for an administrator to assign cases to a group of individuals who can then work on them together, which would be useful for DreamHouse Realty to process customer requests for warranty work. 
Case Escalation is not relevant to the request for a self-serve option for generating cases. 
Email-to-Case would allow customers to email their support requests, but it does not provide a self-serve option through the company's website.  Therefore, it is not the correct solution for this particular request. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000382424&amp;type=1 

An administrator has reviewed an upcoming critical update. How should the administrator proceed with activation of the critical update? 
*Activate the critical update in a sandbox.
Allow the critical update to auto-activate.
Activate the critical update in production.
Allow the critical update to auto-activate in a sandbox.
Explanation: A is the correct answer because it is recommended by Salesforce Marketing Cloud to activate critical updates in a sandbox first to test and ensure that there are no issues with any customizations or integrations before activating it in production. Option B and D are incorrect because allowing the critical update to auto-activate can lead to unforeseen issues in production. Option C is also incorrect because activating the critical update directly in production can cause disruptions and issues that could have been avoided by testing it in a sandbox environment first.

The administrator at DreamHouse Realty added an email quick action to the Case page layout and is unable to see the action on the case feed. Which feature must be enabled to ensure the quick action will be displayed as expected? 
Email Notifications
*Email-to-Case
Email Alerts
Email Templates
Explanation: B is the correct answer because adding an email quick action to the Case page layout means that the administrator wants to create an email related to a particular Case object. Therefore, the Email-to-Case feature must be enabled, which allows users to automatically create cases from incoming emails. This feature ensures that the quick action will be displayed as expected and will allow users to send an email related to the Case object. 
A is incorrect because email notifications are used to notify users when a particular event occurs in the system, such as when a record is created or updated. This feature is not related to the display of quick actions on a page layout.
C is incorrect because email alerts are used to notify users when a particular record meets specific criteria. This feature is also not related to the display of quick actions on a page layout.
D is incorrect because email templates are used to pre-populate emails with standardized content, such as a company signature or a disclaimer. These templates are not related to the display of quick actions on a page layout.

Northern Trail Outfitters has a custom quick action on Account that creates a new Case. How should an administrator make the quick action available on the Salesforce mobile app? 
Create a custom Lightning App with the action.
Modify compact Case page layout to include the action.
Include the action in the Salesforce Mobile Navigation menu.
*Add the Salesforce Mobile and Lightning Experience action to the page layout.
Explanation: The correct answer is D because the question specifically asks how to make the quick action available on the Salesforce mobile app. Option A, creating a custom Lightning App, does not specifically address the mobile app. Option B, modifying the compact Case page layout, also does not address the mobile app specifically. Option C, including the action in the Salesforce Mobile Navigation menu, is a possible solution but is not the best option because it would require users to navigate to the menu to access the quick action, which may not be the most efficient process. Option D, adding the Salesforce Mobile and Lightning Experience action to the page layout, is the correct answer because it specifically addresses how to make the quick action available on the mobile app by adding it to the page layout.

The administrator for Cloud Kicks has created a screen flow to help service reps ask the same set of questions when customers call in with issues. This screen should be visible from cases. How should the screen flow be distributed? 
Page Layout
Component Filter
*Lightning page
Home page
Explanation: C is the correct answer because a Lightning page can be customized to include the screen flow component and placed within the Cases page layout. This ensures that the screen flow is easily accessible to service reps when they are working on a case. 
A Page Layout (option A) is not the best option because it would require service reps to navigate away from the case page to access the screen flow. 
A Component Filter (option B) is not applicable in this scenario as it is a filter used to control visibility of components for specific audiences or pages. 
A Home page (option D) is not relevant to this scenario as it is typically used for displaying high-level metrics or news updates, not for accessing specific tools or flows.

Northern Trail Outfitters is using one profile for all of its marketing users, providing read-only access to the Campaign object. A few marketing users now require comprehensive edit access on Campaigns. How should an administrator fulfil this request? 
*Permission sets
Organization-wide defaults
Marketing user checkbox
Field-level security
Explanation: A is the correct answer because permission sets can be used to grant additional access to specific objects, such as Campaigns, to users who have a restricted profile. The other options, organization-wide defaults, marketing user checkbox, and field-level security, do not directly relate to granting access to the Campaigns object and would not address the specific request from the marketing users.

The support manager at Cloud Kicks wants to respond to customers as quickly as possible. They have requested that the response include the top five troubleshooting tips that could help solve the customer's issue. What should the administrator suggest to meet these requirement? 
*Auto-Response Rules
Email Alerts
Knowledge Articles
Assignment Rules
Explanation: The correct answer is A. Auto-Response Rules. 
Auto-Response Rules allow for an automated email response to be sent to customers when a case is created. This response can include the top five troubleshooting tips, as requested by the support manager, to help solve the customer's issue. 
Email Alerts, on the other hand, are notifications that are sent to specified email addresses when certain criteria are met on a case. While they could be used to alert support personnel to send the top five troubleshooting tips, they do not provide an automated response to the customer. 
Knowledge Articles are articles that provide information and solutions to common issues, but they do not necessarily prioritize the top five troubleshooting tips requested by the support manager. 
Assignment Rules are used to assign cases to specific support personnel, but they do not address the specific requirement of providing the top five troubleshooting tips in an automated response.

Sales and Customer Care at Ursa Major Solar need to see different fields on the Case related list from the Account record. Sales users want to see Case created date and status while Customer Care would like to see owner, status, and contact. What should the administrator use to achieve this? 
Related Lookup Filters
Compact Layout Editor
*Page Layout editor
Search Layout Editor
Explanation: C is the correct answer because the Page Layout editor allows administrators to customize the fields that appear on the related list for a particular object. This will allow them to show different fields to Sales and Customer Care users as needed. 
A is incorrect because related lookup filters only limit the records that appear in a related list, but do not alter the fields displayed. 
B is incorrect because the Compact Layout Editor only allows customization of compact layouts, which are used for a summary of records, not a list of related records. 
D is incorrect because the Search Layout Editor only allows customization of the search results displayed, and not the related list on a page layout.

Northern Trail Outfitters has requested that when the Referral Date field is updated on the custom object Referral Source, the parent object Referral also needs to be updated. Which automation solution should an administrator use to meet this request? 
Lightning Web Component
Approval Process
Workflow Field Update
*Process Builder
Explanation: The correct answer is D, Process Builder, because it can be used to create a process that updates the parent object, Referral, when the Referral Date is updated on the custom object Referral Source. Process Builder provides greater flexibility and functionality than the other automation solutions listed. Lightning Web Components are used for building custom user interfaces and do not provide the necessary functionality for this specific automation request. Approval Processes are used for managing approval requests and do not have the ability to update related objects. Workflow Field Updates are limited to updating fields on the current object and cannot update related objects like the parent Referral object.

Which two solutions could an administrator find on the AppExchange to enhance their organization? Choose 2 answers.  
Communities
*Consultants
*Components
Customers
Explanation: The correct answers are B and C. See reference here: https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxContentListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000FvKly

When users log in to Salesforce via the user interface, which two settings does the system check for authentication? Choose 2 answers.  
*The user's Two-Factor Authentication for API Logins permission
*The role IP address restrictions
The user's profile login hours restrictions
The user's Two-Factor Authentication for User Interface Logins permission
Explanation: A,B is the correct answer because Salesforce's documentation states that when users log in to Salesforce via the user interface, the system checks for authentication based on both the user's IP address and any Two-Factor Authentication for API Logins permission that has been set up. Option C, the user's profile login hours restrictions, applies to when users can log in, but does not determine if they are authenticated. Option D, the user's Two-Factor Authentication for User Interface Logins permission, only applies to authentication for the user interface if it has been set up, but is not checked for every user login.

A user at Cloud Kicks is having issues logging in to Salesforce. The user asks the administrator to reset their password. Which two options should the administrator consider when resetting the user's password? Choose 2 answers.  
Resetting the password will change the user's password policy.
Single sign-on users can reset their own passwords using the forgot password link.
*Resetting a locked-out user's password automatically unlocks the user's account.
*After resetting a password, the user may be required to activate their device to successfully log in to Salesforce.
Explanation: According to Salesforce's documentation, C is correct because resetting a locked-out user's password does unlock the user's account. This is because the lockout is often due to too many failed login attempts, so resetting the password can help resolve this issue. 
Option D is also correct because after resetting a password, the user may be required to activate their device to successfully log in to Salesforce. This is because Salesforce has a security feature called "IP Restriction" that limits access to the user's account from specific IP addresses or devices. By resetting their password, the user may need to activate the new password on their device to gain access to Salesforce. 
Option A is incorrect because resetting the password should not change the user's password policy. The password policy is an organization-wide setting that cannot be affected by resetting one user's password. 
Option B is also incorrect because single sign-on users cannot reset their own passwords using the forgot password link. This is because single sign-on users have a separate login process that uses credentials from their identity provider, and not Salesforce.

AW Computing has six sales teams in a region. These teams always consists of the same account manager, engineer, and assistant. What should the administrator configure to make it easier for teams to collaborate with the same customer? 
Enable and configure standard opportunity teams with splits.
*Enable account teams and show the users how to set up a default account team.
Create a queue for each team and assign account ownership to the queue.
Propose the users manually share all their accounts with their teammates.
Explanation: The correct answer is B. According to Salesforce documentation, account teams are designed to help sales teams collaborate on accounts. By enabling account teams, the administrator can make it easier for teams with the same account manager, engineer, and assistant to work together and share information about the customer. Option A is incorrect because standard opportunity teams are not designed for collaboration on accounts. Option C is also incorrect because creating a queue and assigning account ownership to the queue would not facilitate collaboration among the sales teams. Option D is impractical and not an efficient way to collaborate among sales teams. It would require a lot of manual effort and would not provide a streamlined process for collaboration.

Cloud Kicks has decided to delete a custom field. What will happen to the data in the field when it is deleted? 
The data in the field is stored for 20 days.
*The data is permanently deleted.
The data associated with the field is required.
The data is restorable from the recycle bin.
Explanation: B is the correct answer because Salesforce states in their documentation that when a custom field is deleted, the data in that field is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered. Option A is incorrect as Salesforce does not store the data in the field for any duration of time. Option C is incorrect as it does not pertain to the fate of the data in the field after it is deleted. Option D is also incorrect as Salesforce states that the data in the field cannot be restored from the recycle bin once it has been permanently deleted. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.deleting_fields.htm&amp;type=5

Executives at Cloud Kicks have reported that their dashboards are showing inaccurate data. The administrator has discovered they have been changing the source reports. Which two actions should the administrator take to preserve the integrity of the source reports? Choose 2 answers.  
*Create a new report folder with viewer access.
Move the dashboard to the user's private folder.
*Move the dashboard reports to the view-only folder.
Change the dashboard to be a dynamic dashboard
Explanation: Based on Salesforce's documentation, the correct answer is A, C because: 
A. Creating a new report folder with viewer access will ensure that only authorized users can access and make changes to the reports. This will help preserve the integrity of the reports and prevent unauthorized access or changes. 
B. Moving the dashboard to the user's private folder does not address the issue of the source reports being changed. It only affects the location of the dashboard and does not preserve the integrity of the reports. 
C. Moving the dashboard reports to the view-only folder will ensure that the reports can only be viewed and not modified. This will help preserve the integrity of the reports and prevent unauthorized changes. 
D. Changing the dashboard to be a dynamic dashboard does not address the issue of the source reports being changed. It only affects the type of dashboard and does not preserve the integrity of the reports.

At universal Containers, users would like to be able to share Salesforce records with other members of their team, while collaborating around general topics as well. Which are two considerations for enabling this functionality? Choose 2 answers.  
Collaboration groups are created automatically for every department.
*Object layouts should be configured to include the groups related list.
The Add Record action must be configured in the group publisher.
*An administrator needs to create a group to enable record sharing.
Explanation: Answer C is correct because the group publisher is the place where users can create and share posts, as well as create records for the group they belong to. Therefore, configuring the Add Record action in the group publisher is necessary to enable record sharing.
Answer D is correct because an administrator must create the group that will enable record sharing. The administrator can set the group's access level, specify the group's purpose, and choose the members who can view and collaborate on the records shared within the group.
Answer A is incorrect because collaboration groups are not created automatically for every department. This feature needs to be set up manually by the administrator.
Answer B is incorrect because configuring object layouts to include the groups related list is not necessary to enable record sharing. Although it may offer users easy access to the group records, it does not enable sharing on its own.

Cloud Kicks needs to be able to show different picklist values for sales and marketing users. Which two options will meet this requirement? Choose 2 answers.  
One record type, two profiles, one picklist
Two permission sets, one record type, one picklist
*One page layout, two record types, one picklist
*Two page layouts, one record type, two picklists
Explanation: Option C and D are correct for Cloud Kicks to show different picklist values for sales and marketing users:C. One page layout, two record types, one picklistThis option is a good choice. Having two record types allows for different sets of picklist values. One page layout can be used to control the overall layout, and the picklist values can be specific to each record type.D. Two page layouts, one record type, two picklistsThis option is also correct. Having two page layouts allows for different layouts for sales and marketing users, and using two picklists enables different sets of values for each group.A. One record type, two profiles, one picklistThis option suggests using one record type for both sales and marketing users, with different profiles and a single picklist. However, profiles control the visibility of fields, and using one picklist may not allow for different values for sales and marketing users.B. Two permission sets, one record type, one picklistPermission sets are generally used to grant additional permissions to users, but they don't control picklist values. Having one picklist would still mean the same values for both sales and marketing users.

An administrator has assigned a permission set group with the two-factor authentication for User Interface Logins permissions and the two-factor authentication for API Logins permission to a group of users. Which two prompts will happen when one of the users attempts to log in to Data Loader? Choose 2 answers.  
*Users need to connect an authenticator app to their Salesforce account.
Users need to get a security token from a trusted network using Reset My Security Token.
*Users need to download and install an authenticator app on their mobile device.
Users need to enter a verification code from email or SMS, whichever has higher priority.
Explanation: According to Salesforce's documentation, the correct answer is A and C. This is because the permission set group assigned to the users includes the "two-factor authentication for User Interface Logins" and "two-factor authentication for API Logins" permissions. This means that when the user attempts to log in to Data Loader, they will be prompted to connect an authenticator app to their Salesforce account (option A) and download and install an authenticator app on their mobile device (option C), which are both part of the two-factor authentication process. Options B and D are incorrect because they are not related to two-factor authentication and are not relevant to the prompts that will happen when the user attempts to log in with the assigned permission set group.

Cloud Kicks (CK) is partnering with a used shoe store and second-hand bicycle emporium. CK has an automated business process it wants to run once a week to count the number of open cases related to an account. How should the administrator recommend automating this business process? 
Create a workflow rule with an outbound message.
Set up a scheduled process in Process Builder.
*Configure a scheduled flow in Flow Builder.
Use a process to update the account when it is edited
Explanation: Option C (configure a scheduled flow in Flow Builder) is the correct answer because it allows for automation of the business process of counting open cases related to an account on a scheduled basis. This can be achieved by creating a flow with a scheduled trigger, which will run at the specified time(s) and execute the desired actions. https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/feed/0D54S00000FwsuiSAB 
Option A (create a workflow rule with an outbound message) is incorrect because it does not allow for scheduled automation and is not the most efficient solution for this specific scenario. 
Option B (set up a scheduled process in Process Builder) is incorrect because Process Builder is generally used for automating workflows within Salesforce, not for scheduling a specific process to run at a specific time. 
Option D (use a process to update the account when it is edited) is also incorrect because it does not address the specific business process of counting open cases related to an account on a scheduled basis.

Cloud Kicks wants a reports to categorize accounts into small, medium, and large based on the dollar value found in the Contract Value Field. What feature should an administrator use to meet this request? 
Detail Column
*Bucket Column
Group Rows
Filter Logic
Explanation: The correct answer is B, Bucket Column. Bucketing is a feature in Salesforce that allows you to categorize data based on specific criteria. In this case, the administrator can create a bucket field that categorizes accounts as small, medium, or large based on the value in the Contract Value field. Detail Column only displays the details of the data, Group Rows groups the data by a specific field, and Filter Logic is used to filter data based on specific criteria. Therefore, options A, C, and D are incorrect for this request.

Universal Containers requires that when an Opportunity is closed won, all other open opportunities on the same account must be marked as closed lost. Which automation solution should an administrator use to implement this request? 
Quick Action
Workflow Rule
*Flow Builder
Outbound Message
Explanation: The correct answer is C, Flow Builder, because it allows for more complex automations with multiple actions and conditions. A Quick Action only allows for a single action, such as updating a field, and would not be sufficient for this requirement. A Workflow Rule can only be triggered by a change to a record, whereas the requirement is based on the closure of an Opportunity, which may not result in a change to the record. An Outbound Message is used for integrating with external systems and would not be useful for this internal process. Therefore, Flow Builder is the best option for implementing this requirement as it allows for multiple actions and conditions to be applied when triggered by the closure of an Opportunity. https://theblogreaders.com/updating-opportunities-closed-lost-another-opportunity-marked-closed-won-using-record-triggered-salesforce-flow/

Which two capabilities are considerations when marking a field as required in Object Manager? Choose 2 answers.  
The field is not required to save records via the API on that object.
*The field is universally required to save a record on that object.
*The field is added to every page layout on that object.
The field is optional when saving records via web-to-lead and web-to-case
Explanation: When marking a field as required in Object Manager, there are two key considerations to keep in mind.Firstly, marking a field as required means that it is universally required to save a record on that object. This means that users will not be able to save a record unless the required fields are populated. This applies to all methods of saving records, including via the UI, API, or any other method.
Secondly, when a field is marked as required, it will be added to every page layout on that object. This ensures that users are always prompted to enter a value for the required field, regardless of which page layout they are using.It's also worth noting that marking a field as required does not impact the behavior of web-to-lead and web-to-case forms. These forms may still allow the field to be optional, depending on how they are configured.

The administrator at Cloud Kicks has created an approval process for time off requests. Which two automated actions are available to be added as part of the approval process? Choose 2 answers.  
*Field Update
Chatter Post
Auto launched Flow
*Email Alert
Explanation: A is correct because Field Update can be added to an approval process for updates or changes to the records, fields or values once the approval process is complete.
D is correct because Email Alert can be used to send email notifications to the user notifying them of approvals or rejections. 
B is incorrect because Chatter Post cannot be added as an automated action in an approval process. 
C is incorrect because Auto launched Flow cannot be added as an automated action in an approval process.

An administrator at Universal Containers has been asked to prevent users from accessing Salesforce from outside of their network. What are two considerations for this configuration? Choose 2 answers.  
*IP address restrictions are set on the profile or globally for the org.
Users can change their password to avoid login IP restrictions.
*Enforce Login IP Ranges on Every Request must be selected to enforce IP restrictions.
Single sign-on will allow users to log in from anywhere.
Explanation: The correct answers are A and C.
A is correct because IP address restrictions can be set on the profile or globally for the org to limit access to only certain IP addresses.
C is correct because Enforce Login IP Ranges on Every Request must be selected to enforce IP restrictions. This setting will require users to log in from an approved IP address range every time they access Salesforce.
B is incorrect because users changing their password has no effect on IP restrictions.
D is incorrect because single sign-on would potentially allow users to bypass IP restrictions if they are able to authenticate through their external identity provider.

What are three characteristics of a master-detail relationship? Choose 3 answers.  
*The master object can be a standard or custom object.
Permissions for the detail record are set independently of the master.
Each object can have up to five master-detail relationships.
*Roll-up summaries are supported in master-detail relationships.
*The owner field on the detail records is the owner of the master record.
Explanation: A is correct because a master-detail relationship can be defined between a standard or custom object. D is correct because the roll-up summary fields can be defined on the master object in a master-detail relationship. E is correct because the owner of the master record will be the owner of the child.B is incorrect because permissions for the detail record are controlled by the parent record, meaning the master object, in a master-detail relationship.C is incorrect because each object can have up to two master-detail relationships, not up to five. Reference: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.relationships_considerations.htm&amp;type=5 

The sales manager at Cloud Kicks wants to set up a business process where opportunity discounts over 30% need to be approved by the VP of sales. Any discounts above 10% need to be approved by the user's manager. The administrator has been tasked with creating an approval process. Which are two considerations the administrator needs to review before setting up this approval process? Choose 2 answers.  
*Create a custom Discount field on the opportunity to capture the discount amount
*Populate the Manager standard field on the sales users' User Detail page.
Configure two separate approval processes.
Allow the submitter choose the approver manually.
Explanation: A and B are the correct answers because:
A. Create a custom Discount field on the opportunity to capture the discount amount.
The administrator should create a custom field on the opportunity record to capture the discount amount. This will allow the system to determine whether a particular discount requires approval based on its size.
B. Populate the Manager standard field on the sales users' User Detail page.
The administrator should populate the Manager standard field on the sales users' User Detail pages. This will allow the system to determine which manager should be responsible for approving discounts above 10%.
C. Configure two separate approval processes.
This is not required because the approval process can use multiple steps to route the approval request to different users based on the discount amount. One approval process can be set up to handle both scenarios.
D. Allow the submitter choose the approver manually.
This is not recommended because it can lead to inconsistent and unpredictable approvals. The approval process should be set up to automatically route the approval request to the correct approver based on the discount amount and user's manager.

An administrator at Cloud Kicks has a flow in production that is supposed to create new records. However, no new records are being created. What could the issue be? 
The flow is read only.
*The flow is inactive.
The flow URL is deactivated.
The flow trigger is missing.
Explanation: B is the correct answer because if the flow is inactive, it will not execute and no new records will be created. Option A is incorrect because a read-only flow would not attempt to create new records. Option C is incorrect because deactivating the flow URL would only prevent access to the flow, but it would not affect the functionality of the flow itself. Option D is incorrect because a missing flow trigger would prevent the flow from being executed at all, rather than just preventing new records from being created.

An administrator at Cloud Kicks is building a flow that needs to search for records that meet certain conditions and store values from those records in variable for use later in the flow. What flow element should the administrator add? 
Assignment
*Get Records
Create Records
Update Records
Explanation: According to Salesforce's documentation, the correct flow element to use in this scenario is the "Get Records" element. This element allows the administrator to search for records that meet specific criteria and store the relevant values in variables for later use in the flow. This functionality is not available in the other options. Option A, "Assignment," is used to set a specific value to a variable, it does not retrieve records. Option C, "Create Records," is used to create new records, not search for and retrieve existing ones. Option D, "Update Records," is used to modify existing records, not retrieve them.

Ursa Major Solar has its business hours set from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM for the reps that are on pacific time. The reps on Eastern Time need business hours set to start 3 hours earlier to cover for support. How should an administrator solve for this issue? 
Set temporary business hours for each time zone.
Adjust the currant business hours to accommodate the Eastern Time Zone.
*Create one set of business hours per time zone.
Allow the reps to set business hours manually.
Explanation: The correct answer is C. Salesforce's documentation recommends creating one set of business hours per time zone to solve this issue. This allows the system to automatically adjust the business hours based on the user's time zone, ensuring that the correct hours are displayed for each rep. Option A of setting temporary business hours for each time zone is not a scalable solution and would require manual changes every time the time zone changes. Option B of adjusting the current business hours would affect all reps, not just those in the Eastern Time Zone. Option D of allowing reps to manually set their own business hours would not ensure consistent coverage for support.

Sales reps at Northern Trail Outfitters have asked for a way to change the Probability field value of their Opportunities. What should an administrator suggest to meet this request? 
Define a new Stage picklist value.
Create a custom field on Opportunity.
Configure Forecasting support.
*Make the field editable on page layouts
Explanation: Answer D is correct because it directly addresses the sales reps' request to change the Probability field value of their Opportunities. Making the field editable on page layouts allows sales reps to easily modify the value without having to navigate through other screens or menus. 
Answers A, B, and C do not address the specific request of changing the Probability field value. Defining a new Stage picklist value could potentially impact the Probability field, but it does not directly allow sales reps to modify the Probability field value. Creating a custom field on Opportunity also does not address the request for modifying the Probability field value. Configuring Forecasting support is a separate feature that involves predicting sales revenue and does not directly allow for changing the Probability field value.

Universal Containers requires a different Lightning page to be displayed when Accounts are viewed in the Sales Console and in the Service Console. How should an administrator meet this requirement? 
Update page layout assignments.
Define multiple record types.
*Assign Lightning pages as app default.
Create different user profiles.
Explanation: Universal containers require a different lightning page to be displayed when accounts are viewed in the sales console and in the service console. An administrator should meet this requirement by assigning Lightning pages as Default.
A user's view of the Lightning Components is controlled by the Record Page, which essentially sits on top of the Page Layout. In order to access Record Page Assignment, we must first visit: Lightning APP Builder's Settings → Quick Find → Search → Record Page → Next. Lightning Record Pages may be allocated to users in three different ways: Org Default, App Default, and App, Record Type and Profile. Org Default: All profiles that are assigned the Record Page by Org Default have the same page structure for all users. First, save the page, and then most crucially, activate it. Steps to activate Org Default: Activation →  Assign as Org Default → Select Assign Form Factor → Save. App Default: The Record Page is designated as the default for a certain app by App Default. Consider that having a sales app and a marketing app enables consumers of each app a more individualized user experience. First, save the page, and then most crucially, activate it. Steps to Activate App Default: Activation → Assign as App Default → Select Apps → Select Form Factor → Save
App, Record Type and Profile: By designing unique record pages and allocating them according to an app, a record type, and a user profile, we can tailor the experiences of our various users. First, save the page, and then most crucially, activate it. Steps to Activate App, Record Type, and Profile: Activation →  Assign as App, Record Type, and Profile → Select Apps → Select Form Factor → Select Record Type → Select Profile → Save. Therefore, an administrator should meet this requirement by assigning Lightning pages as Default.

The Sales director at Cloud Kicks wants to be able to predict upcoming revenue in the next several fiscal quarters so they can set goals and benchmark how reps are performing. Which two features should the administrator configure? Choose 2 answers.  
*Sales Quotes
Opportunity List View
*Forecasting
Opportunity Stages
Explanation: The correct answers are A and C. 
Sales Quotes and Forecasting are the two features that can help the Sales director at Cloud Kicks predict upcoming revenue in the next several fiscal quarters. Sales Quotes enable sales reps to create quotes and send them to prospects, which can help close deals quicker and give the Sales director a clearer picture of upcoming revenue. Forecasting allows users to create forecasts based on historical data, which can help predict future revenue and set goals for reps. 
Option B, Opportunity List View, is simply a way to view and sort existing opportunities, not a feature that helps predict future revenue. Option D, Opportunity Stages, is also not directly related to predicting revenue, although it is an important part of the sales process.

Which two actions should an administrator perform with Case escalation rules? Choose 2 answers.  
Re-open the Case.
*Send email notifications.
Change the Case Priority.
*Re-assign the Case.
Explanation: The correct answers are B and D, because according to Salesforce's documentation, Case escalation rules can automatically re-assign Cases to different users or queues, and can also send email notifications to relevant parties to inform them of the escalation. Options A and C do not pertain to Case escalation rules as they are not actions that can be performed through the escalation process. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.rules_escalation_actions.htm&amp;type=5

AW Computing (AWC) occasionally works with independent contractors, who the company stores as Contacts in Salesforce. Contractors often change agencies, and AWC wants to maintain the historical accuracy of the record. What should AWC use to track Contacts? 
Use a partner community to track the Contacts.
Create a new Contact record for each agency.
*Create a Junction object to track many-to-many relationship.
Enable Contacts to multiple Accounts.
Explanation: C is the correct answer because creating a Junction object allows for a many-to-many relationship between Contacts and agencies, allowing AWC to maintain historical accuracy by tracking which agency each Contact has worked with over time. Option A, using a partner community, does not address the need for historical accuracy. Option B, creating a new Contact record for each agency, could result in duplicate records and does not provide a way to track historical changes. Option D, enabling Contacts to have multiple Accounts, also does not address the need for historical accuracy and can lead to confusion in tracking which agency the Contact actually worked with at a given time.

An administrator gets a rush request from Human Resources to remove a user's access to Salesforce Immediately. The user is part of a hierarchy field called Direct Manager. What should the administrator do to fulfil the request? 
*Freeze the user to prevent them from logging in while removing them from being referenced in the Direct Manager field.
Deactivate the user and delete any records where they are referenced in the Direct Manager field.
Change the user's profile to read-only while removing them from being referenced in the Direct Manager Field.
Delete the user and leave all records where they referenced in the Direct Manager Field without changes.
Explanation: A is the correct answer because freezing the user will prevent them from logging in while removing them from being referenced in the Direct Manager field, which effectively removes their access to Salesforce. Option B is incorrect because deleting records where the user is referenced in the Direct Manager field could cause data inconsistencies and implications for the organization. Option C is incorrect because changing the user's profile to read-only does not revoke their access to Salesforce, and it does not remove them from being referenced in the Direct Manager field. Option D is incorrect because deleting the user without removing them from the Direct Manager field could cause data inconsistencies and implications for the organization.

An administrator created a record-triggered flow to update contacts. How should the administrator reference the values of the active record the flow is running on? 
Use the 'Contact.Id' global variable.
Use the 'Account.Id' record variable.
*Use the 'Record' global variable.
Use the 'Get Records' element to find the Id.
Explanation: The correct answer is C. According to Salesforce documentation, the 'Record' global variable represents the active record that the flow is currently running on. This variable allows the administrator to reference the values of the fields on that record. Option A is incorrect because it specifically references the 'Contact' object and may not work if the flow is being run on a different object. Option B is incorrect because it references the 'Account' object, which may not be relevant to the flow or active record. Option D is incorrect because it suggests using the 'Get Records' element, which is unnecessary since the flow is already running on an active record.

A sales rep has a list of 300 accounts with contacts that they want to load at one time. Which tool should the administrator utilize to import the records to salesforce? 
Dataloader.io
Data Loader
Manual Import
*Data Import Wizard
Explanation: D is the correct answer because Data Import Wizard is the best tool to import data for many standard Salesforce objects, including accounts, contacts, leads, solutions, campaign members, and person accounts. You can import up to 50,000 records at a time. If you are working with more records than that, you will need to use the Data Loader. Reference: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.import_with_data_import_wizard.htm&amp;type=5Data Loader needs to be installed locally to your device for you to use it, and it allows you to connect to any Salesforce org that you have credentials for. Reference: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.data_loader.htm&amp;type=5

Sales users at Universal Containers are reporting that it is taking a long time to edit opportunity records. Normally, the only field they are editing is the Stage field. Which two options should the administrator recommend to help simplify the process? Choose 2 answers.  
*Add a path for stage to the opportunity record page.
Use a Kanban list view for Opportunity.
Configure an auto launched flow for Opportunity editing.
*Create a simplified Opportunity page layout.
Explanation: According to Salesforce's documentation, options A and D are correct answers because:
A. Adding a path for the Stage field on the opportunity record page can help users easily edit and update the field without navigating through multiple pages, which can save time and improve efficiency.
D. Creating a simplified Opportunity page layout can reduce clutter and unnecessary fields, making it easier for users to quickly update the Stage field without being overwhelmed by other information.
Option B, using a Kanban list view for Opportunity, may not necessarily address the issue since it only displays a visual representation of opportunities, but it doesn't necessarily simplify the actual editing process.
Option C, configuring an auto-launched flow for Opportunity editing, may introduce more complexity and may not necessarily simplify the process since it requires additional steps and configuration.

Ursa Major Solar wants to automatically notify a manager about any cases awaiting a response from an agent for more than 2 hours after case creation. Which feature should an administrator use to fulfill this requirement? 
Assignment Rule
*Case Escalation Rule
Omni-Channel Supervisor
Formula Field
Explanation: B is the correct answer because a Case Escalation Rule can be used to automatically escalate a case to a manager when certain criteria are met, such as when a case is waiting for a response from an agent for more than 2 hours. The other options do not provide this specific functionality. 
A - Assignment Rules are used to assign cases to specific agents, queues or users based on certain criteria. It does not provide the option to escalate cases.
C - Omni-Channel Supervisor is used to manage agent availability, chat sessions, and monitor agent activity. It does not provide the option to escalate cases.
D - Formula Field is used to calculate and display values based on certain criteria. It does not provide the option to automate case escalation.

Cloud Kicks wants users to only be able to choose Opportunity stage closed won if the Lead source has been selected. How should the administrator accomplish this goal? 
Make Lead Source a dependent picklist to the Opportunity stage field.
*Configure a validation rule requiring Lead Source when the stage is set to closed won.
Change the Opportunity stage field to read only on the page layout.
Modify the Opportunity stage a dependent picklist to the Lead source field.
Explanation: The correct answer is B because it suggests using a validation rule to check whether the Lead Source has been selected when the Opportunity stage is set to closed won. This ensures that the user cannot proceed to close the Opportunity without selecting the Lead Source first. 
Option A is incorrect because it suggests making Lead Source a dependent picklist to the Opportunity stage field, which is not the desired outcome. 
Option C is incorrect because it suggests making the Opportunity stage field read-only on the page layout, which does not address the need to validate whether the Lead Source has been selected. 
Option D is incorrect because it suggests modifying the Opportunity stage to a dependent picklist to the Lead source field, which may result in a different problem altogether, where users must select a Lead Source before selecting the Opportunity stage, regardless of whether the stage is closed won or not.

An administrator at Universal Containers needs a simple way to trigger an alert to the director of sales when opportunities reach an amount of $500,000. What should the administrator configure to meet this requirement? 
*Set up Big Deal Alerts for the amount.
Enable Opportunity Update Reminders
Opportunity warning in Kanban View.
Key Deals component on the homepage
Explanation: A is the correct answer because Big Deal Alerts are specifically designed to notify specified users when an opportunity meets or exceeds a certain amount. Option B, Opportunity Update Reminders, will not trigger an alert to a specific user, but simply remind users to update opportunities. Option C, Opportunity warning in Kanban View, will display a warning but not trigger a specific notification to the director of sales. Option D, Key Deals component on the homepage, provides a summary of important deals but does not trigger a notification for a specific amount.

Cloud Kicks wants to allow customers to create their own cases while visiting its public homepage. What should the administrator recommend? 
SMS Response
*Web-to-Case
Email-to-Case
Omni-Channel
Explanation: The correct answer is B. Web-to-Case. 
Salesforce's documentation explains that Web-to-Case allows organizations to capture case information directly from their website's contact page and automatically create cases in Salesforce. This is the recommended solution for organizations that want to allow customers to create their own cases while visiting the public homepage. 
Option A, SMS Response, is not applicable to this scenario as it is a messaging service and does not provide a way for customers to create their own cases on the public homepage. 
Option C, Email-to-Case, is another option for capturing customer inquiries, but it requires customers to send an email to a particular email address rather than directly creating a case on the website. 
Option D, Omni-Channel, is not applicable to this scenario as it is a feature that allows routing and managing work items from different channels, such as social media and chat, but does not provide a way for customers to create their own cases on the public homepage.

Northern Trail Outfitters wants to calculate how much revenue has been generated for each of its marketing campaigns. How should an administrator deliver this information? 
*Design a standard Campaign report and add the value Won Opportunities in Campaign field.
Perform periodic data job to update campaign records.
Create a roll-up summary field on Opportunity to Campaign.
Add a Total Value Field on campaign and use a workflow rule to update the value when an opportunity is won.
Explanation: A is the correct answer because designing a standard Campaign report and adding the value Won Opportunities in Campaign field will allow the administrator to calculate how much revenue has been generated for each marketing campaign. This report will give a summary of the number of closed/won opportunities associated with each Campaign, and the total value of those Opportunities. 
B is incorrect because a periodic data job to update campaign records will not provide real-time data and may not fully reflect the revenue generated for each marketing campaign. 
C is incorrect because creating a roll-up summary field on Opportunity to Campaign will only allow the administrator to view the total value of all Opportunities associated with a Campaign, not the revenue generated for each marketing campaign. 
D is incorrect because adding a Total Value Field on Campaign and using a workflow rule to update the value when an opportunity is won will require manual updates and will not provide real-time data.

An administrator installed a managed package that contains a permission set group. The permission set group that was installed includes Delete access on several objects, and the administrator needs to prevent users in the permission set group from being able to delete records. What should the administrator do to control Delete access? 
*Use a muting permission set with a permission set group to mute selected permissions.
Create a new permission set that has Delete access deselected for the objects.
Create a new role that prevents Delete permissions from rolling up to the users.
Edit the profile for the users to remove Delete access from the objects.
Explanation: A is the correct answer because using a muting permission set with a permission set group allows the administrator to selectively mute certain permissions, such as Delete access on specific objects, for users within the permission set group. This allows the administrator to maintain the benefits of the managed package while still controlling the specific permissions granted to users. https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/permission-set-groups/mute-permissions-in-permission-set-groups. 
B is incorrect because creating a new permission set without Delete access for the objects would remove the benefit of the managed package and could potentially cause conflicts with the package's functionality. 
C is incorrect because creating a new role that prevents Delete permissions from rolling up to the users would not be effective in this scenario since the Delete permissions are already granted through the permission set group in the managed package. 
D is incorrect because editing the profile for the users to remove Delete access from the objects would remove the permission for all users with that profile, rather than selectively muting the permission for only those within the permission set group.

Northern Trail Outfitters has two different sales processes: one for business opportunities with four stages and one for partner opportunities with eight stages. Both processes will vary in page layouts and picklist value options. What should an administrator configure to meet these requirements? 
Validation rules that ensure that users are entering accurate sales stage information.
Different page layouts that control the picklist values for the opportunity types.
Public groups to limit record types and sales processes for opportunities.
*Separate record types and Sales processes for the different types of opportunities.
Explanation: The correct answer is D. Salesforce documentation states that to accommodate different sales processes, separate record types and sales processes should be created for each. This allows for different page layouts and picklist value options to be assigned to each sales process. Validation rules can also be created for each sales process if needed. Option A is incorrect because validation rules alone cannot control page layouts and picklist values. Option B is partially correct, but it does not address the need for separate sales processes. Option C is incorrect because public groups do not have any relationship with record types or sales processes.

A sales rep has left the company and an administrator has been asked to re-assign all their accounts and opportunities to a new sales rep and keep the teams as is. Which tool should an administrator use to accomplish this? 
Data Loader
*Mass Transfer Tool
Data Import Wizard
Dataloader.io
Explanation: B is the correct answer because the Mass Transfer Tool is specifically designed to reassign records, such as accounts and opportunities, from one user to another while keeping the associated teams intact. It allows for the mass transfer of ownership of records from one user to another with just a few clicks, and it also ensures that sharing and security settings are maintained. 
A is incorrect because the Data Loader is a bulk data import and export tool and does not have the capability to transfer ownership of records.
C is incorrect because the Data Import Wizard is also a tool for importing data but does not have the capability to transfer ownership of records.
D is incorrect because Dataloader.io is simply a third-party data loading tool and does not have specific functionality for transferring ownership of records.

The VP of sales at Dreamhouse Realty has requested a dashboard to visualize enterprise sales across the different teams. The key place of data is the total of all sales for the year and the progress to the enterprise sales goal. What dashboard component will effectively show this number and the proximity to the total goal as a single value? 
Table
Stacked Bar
Donut
*Gauge
Explanation: D is the correct answer because a gauge component is designed to effectively show a single value, such as the total sales for the year and its proximity to the enterprise sales goal. A table component would not effectively show this as a single value, as it displays data in rows and columns. A stacked bar component is designed to show proportions or percentages, not single values. A donut component is similar to a pie chart and is used to show proportions or percentages as well.

The service manager at Ursa Major Solar wants to let customers know that they have received their cases via email and their websites. Medium-priority and high-priority cases should receive different email notifications than low-priority cases. The administrator has created three email templates for this purpose. How should an administrator configure this requirement? 
Include three assignment rules that fire when cases are created. Add a filter for case priority. Select the appropriate email template for each rule.
Add three auto-response rules. Configure one rule entry criteria for each rule and set a filter for case priority. Select the appropriate email template for each rule entry.
Configure one workflow rule that fires when cases are created. Add a filter for case priority. Select the appropriate email template for the rule.
*Create one auto-response rule. Configure three rule entry criteria and set a filter for case priority. Select the appropriate email template for each rule entry.
Explanation: D is the correct answer because it suggests creating one auto-response rule for notifying customers about their case receipts via email and website. The rule should have three rule entry criteria (one for each case priority) and should be configured with appropriate email templates for each criterion. This solution is efficient and clean because it can be managed easily, resulting in fewer rules to maintain. Option A is incorrect because it requires three separate assignment rules instead of a single auto-response rule. B is incorrect because auto-response rules are designed to notify customers. However, it doesn't fulfill the requirement of notifying customers via email and their website. Option C is also incorrect because it only creates one workflow rule, and it doesn't cover different types of cases based on priorities.

Ursa Major Solar uses Opportunity to track sales of solar energy products. The company has two separate sales teams that focus on different energy markets. The Services team also wants to use Opportunity to track installation. All three teams will need to use different fields and stages. How Should the administrator configure this requirement? 
Create three sales processes. Create three record types and one page layout.
Create one sales process. Create three record types and three page layouts.
*Create three sales processes. Create three record types and three page layouts.
Create one sales process. Create one record type and three page layouts.
Explanation: The correct answer is C, create three sales processes, create three record types and three page layouts.
This is because the scenario mentions that there are three different teams that will be using Opportunity to track different aspects of the sales process. Each team will require different fields and stages to be tracked. By creating three sales processes, each team can have their own set of stages and fields, allowing for different tracking and reporting needs. 
Creating three record types will allow each team to have their own set of fields and page layouts that are specific to their needs. This will make it easier for each team to view and track their own information without being overwhelmed by irrelevant information. 
Option A and D are incorrect because they only allow for one sales process or record type which will not be sufficient for the multiple teams involved. Option B is also incorrect as only one sales process will not allow for the necessary customization for each team.

The administrator at Cloud Kicks has been asked to replace two old workflow rules that are doing simple field updates when a lead is created to improve processing time. What tool should the administrator use to replace the workflow rules? 
Quick Action Flow
*Before Save Flow
Scheduled Flow
Screen Flow
Explanation: The correct answer is B. Before Save Flow. According to Salesforce documentation, "Before-save flows are optimized to update records automatically and quickly based on changes to a record's values. They operate behind the scenes, so users aren't required to click submit or save. You can use before-save flows to update single records or many records at once." Therefore, before-save flow is the appropriate tool to use to improve processing time for field updates when a lead is created. The other options listed, such as Quick Action Flow, Scheduled Flow, and Screen Flow, are not specifically designed for automatic record updates and may not provide the same level of optimization for processing time.

Ursa Solar Major is evaluating Salesforce for its service team and would like to know what objects were available out of the box. Which three of the standard objects are available to an administrator considering a support use case? Choose 3 answers.  
*Contract
*Case
Ticket
Request
*Account
Explanation: The correct answers for this question are A, B, and E. 
A - Contract: This object can be used for creating and tracking customer contracts which can be useful for support use cases. 
B - Case: This object is the most commonly used for support teams to track and manage customer issues and requests. 
E - Account: This object represents a customer's account which can be helpful for managing support cases and providing personalized support. 
C and D - Ticket and Request are not standard Salesforce objects for support use cases.

The marketing team wants a new picklist value added to the Campaign Member Status field for the upsell promotional campaign. Which two solutions should the administrator use to modify the picklist field values? Choose 2 answers.  
*Add the Campaign Member Statuses related list to the Page Layout.
Edit the picklist values for the Campaign Status in object Manager.
Mass modify the Campaign Member Statuses related list.
*Modify the picklist value on the Campaign Member Statuses related list
Explanation: A is correct because adding the Campaign Member Statuses related list to the Page Layout will allow the administrator to view and edit the picklist values for that field.
D is correct because modifying the picklist value on the Campaign Member Statuses related list directly modifies the values for that field.
B is incorrect because modifying the picklist values for the Campaign Status in object Manager will not affect the picklist values for the Campaign Member Status field.
C is incorrect because mass modifying the Campaign Member Statuses related list could potentially change multiple values at once, which may not be the desired outcome. https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000384463&amp;type=1 

Users have noticed that when they click on a report in a dashboard to view the report details, the values in the report are different from the values displayed on the dashboard. What are the two reasons this is likely to occur? Choose 2 answers.  
The report needs to be refreshed.
*The dashboard needs to be refreshed.
The current user does not have access to the report folder.
*The running dashboard user and viewer have different permissions.
Explanation: Answer: B, D are the correct choices.
Explanation: According to Salesforce's documentation, when a user clicks on a report within a dashboard, the dashboard will open the report using the viewer's permissions. This means that if the running dashboard user and the viewer have different permissions, the values displayed in the report may differ from what is displayed in the dashboard. Therefore, choice D is correct. 
Option A is incorrect because refreshing the report would not affect the values displayed in the dashboard. 
Option C is also incorrect because if the current user did not have access to the report folder, they would not be able to see the report in the dashboard at all. 
Therefore, options B and D are the most likely reasons why the values in the report are different from the values displayed on the dashboard.

What are two considerations an administrator should keep in mind when working with Salesforce objects? Choose 2 answers.  
*Custom and standard objects have standard fields.
*Standard objects are included with Salesforce.
A new standard object can be created.
Only standard objects support master-detail relationships.
Explanation: A,B are the correct answers because they both provide relevant information about working with Salesforce objects. Option A mentions the existence of standard fields in both custom and standard objects, which is important to keep in mind when creating and managing fields. Option B highlights the fact that standard objects are already included in Salesforce, so admins should be aware of which ones are available and how they can be used. Options C and D are both incorrect because they do not provide considerations related to working with Salesforce objects as a whole. Option C addresses the creation of a new standard object, which is not a consideration for admins already working with objects. Option D is incorrect because custom objects can also support master-detail relationships, not just standard objects.

Cloud Kicks is working on a better way to track its product shipments utilizing Salesforce. Which field type should an administrator use to capture coordinates? 
*Geolocation
Geofence
Custom address
External lookup
Explanation: A is the correct answer because geolocation is the field type designed specifically for capturing latitude and longitude coordinates, which are essential for tracking product shipments. 
B, Geofence, is incorrect because it is a type of virtual boundary used for triggering location-based actions, but it doesn't capture coordinates. 
C, Custom address, is also incorrect because it captures address information but not coordinates. 
D, External lookup, is incorrect because it is used to retrieve data from an external system, not to capture coordinates.

When a Sales rep clicks a button on an opportunity, a simple discount calculator screen should be launched. Which automation tool should an administrator use to build this discount calculator screen? 
*Flow Builder
Workflow Rule
Platform Event
Process Builder
Explanation: A is the correct answer because Flow Builder is an automation tool that allows the creation of custom screens and forms for users to interact with, and can be triggered by a button click on a record. This makes it an ideal tool to build a custom screen for a discount calculator that can be launched when a Sales rep clicks a button on an opportunity.
B is not the correct answer because Workflow Rules are used to automate standard internal processes and business rules, and do not provide the ability to build custom screens or forms for user interaction.
C is not the correct answer because Platform Events are used to integrate Salesforce with external systems and do not provide the ability to build custom screens or forms for user interaction.
D is not the correct answer because Process Builder is an automation tool that allows the creation of automated processes with point-and-click configuration, but does not provide the ability to build custom screens or forms for user interaction. 

Universal Containers is trying to improve the user experience when searching for the right status on a case. The company currently has one support process that is used for all record types on cases. The support process has 10 status values. Service reps say they never need more than five depending on what kind of case they are working on. How should the administrator improve on the current implementation? 
Reduce the number of case status values to five.
Create a Screen Flow that shows only the correct values for status and surface the flow in the utility bar of the console.
*Review which status choices are needed for each record type and create support processes for each that is necessary.
Edit the status choices directly on the record type.
Explanation: The correct answer is C because it addresses the issue of having too many status values by reviewing which status choices are needed for each record type and creating support processes for each that is necessary. This allows for a more customized user experience and eliminates unnecessary status values for certain types of cases. 
A is incorrect because reducing the number of case status values to five does not take into account the different types of cases and their unique needs. 
B is a possible solution, but it does not address the root issue of having too many status values in the current support process. 
D is also a possible solution, but it does not address the issue of having too many status values for certain types of cases and could potentially create confusion for service reps if they are presented with irrelevant status choices. 

The administrator at Cloud Kicks has a Custom picklist field on Lead, which is missing on the Contact when leads are converted. Which two items should the administrator do to make sure these values are populated? Choose 2 answers.  
*Create a custom picklist field on Contact.
Update the picklist value with a validation rule.
*Map the picklist field on the Lead to the Contact.
Set the picklist field to be required on the Lead Object.
Explanation: The correct answers are A and C because:
A. To make sure that the missing custom picklist field values on Lead are populated on the converted Contact, the administrator needs to create a corresponding custom picklist field on the Contact.
C. Additionally, the administrator needs to map the picklist field on the Lead to the Contact so that values selected on the Lead are transferred over to the Contact during conversion.
B and D are incorrect because:
B. Updating the picklist value with a validation rule does not ensure that the value will be populated on the converted Contact. It only verifies that the selected value is valid according to the validation rule criteria.
D. Setting the picklist field to be required on the Lead object does not automatically transfer the values to the Contact during conversion. It only ensures that the field is required and cannot be left blank when creating or editing a Lead.Reference: https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.customize_fields.htm&amp;type=5

Northern Trail Outfitters wants to track ROI for contacts that are key stakeholders for opportunities. The VP of Sales requested that this information be accessible on the opportunity and available for reporting. Which two options should the administrator configure to meet these requirements? Choose 2 answers.  
Customize Campaign Member Role.
Add the Campaign Member related list to the Opportunity page layout.
Customize Campaign Role.
*Customize Opportunity Contact Role.
*Add the Opportunity Contact Role related list to the Opportunity page layout.
Explanation: The correct answer is D and E. 
A and C are incorrect because they refer to customizing Campaign roles and member roles, which are not relevant to tracking ROI for contacts that are key stakeholders for opportunities. 
B is incorrect because adding the Campaign Member related list to the Opportunity page layout does not directly address the requirement to track ROI for contacts. 
D is correct because customizing Opportunity Contact Role allows for the tracking of the specific contacts that are key stakeholders for opportunities. 
E is correct because adding the Opportunity Contact Role related list to the Opportunity page layout makes it accessible and available for reporting, as requested by the VP of Sales. 

The VP of sales at Universal Containers wants to prevent members of the sales team from changing an opportunity to a date in the past.
Assignment Rule
*Validation Rule
Field-Level Security
Approval Process
Explanation: B is the correct answer because a validation rule can be used to prevent members of the sales team from changing an opportunity to a date in the past. Validation rules evaluate data before it’s entered into the database and can prevent invalid data from being saved. In this case, a validation rule can be created to check if the opportunity date is in the past and if so, prevent the user from saving the record. 
Option A, Assignment Rule, is incorrect because it is used to automatically assign records to users based on specified criteria.
Option C, Field-Level Security, is incorrect because it is used to restrict access to specific fields in a record based on a user's profile.
Option D, Approval Process, is also incorrect because it is used to automate the approval of certain types of records based on specified criteria. 

The Client services and customer support teams share the same profile but have different permission sets. The Custom Object Retention related list needs to be restricted to the client services team on the Lightning record page layout.
Sharing settings
Page Layout Assignment
*Component Visibility
Record Type Assignment
Explanation: The correct answer is C. Component Visibility. 
Sharing settings control access to records, not specific components on a record page layout. Page Layout Assignment assigns different page layouts to different record types or profiles, but does not control component visibility. Record Type Assignment is also not relevant to controlling component visibility on a record page layout. 
Therefore, the administrator should use Component Visibility to restrict the Custom Object Retention related list to the client services team on the Lightning record page layout. 

An administrator wants to create a form in Salesforce for users to fill out when they lose a client.
Process Builder
Approval Process
Outbound Message
*Flow Builder
Explanation: The correct answer is D Flow Builder. According to Salesforce's documentation, Flow Builder is a tool that enables users to create wizards, surveys, and multi-step processes to collect information from users or automate business processes. It allows for the creation of screens to collect data from users, and can be used for various use cases such as creating a form for users to fill out when a client is lost. Process Builder is used to automate simple business processes, Approval Process is used to automate approval workflows, and Outbound Message is used to send messages to external systems when a record is created or updated. These tools do not have the capability to create a wizard or form. 

An administrator has been asked to update a flow that was created as part of a recent update. When the administrator opens the flow for editing, the Flow toolbox offers only four elements: Assignment, Decision, Get Records, and Loop.
The flow is a screen flow.
The version of the flow is inactive.
*The flow is a before save flow.
The version of the flow is activated.
Explanation: C is the correct answer because "before save" flows only have access to a limited set of elements, which includes Assignment, Decision, Get Records, and Loop. Options A and D are incorrect because they do not explain why only these four elements are available in the Flow toolbox. Option B is also incorrect because an inactive version of the flow would not affect the availability of elements in the Flow toolbox.

Users at Cloud Kicks are reporting different options when uploading a custom picklist on the Opportunity object based on the kind of opportunity.
Fields and relationships
Related lookup filters
*Record Type
Picklist value sets
Explanation: C is the correct answer because record types allow administrators to control which picklist values are available based on certain criteria, such as the type of opportunity. Option A (Fields and relationships) is incorrect because it doesn't provide the necessary functionality to control picklist values. Option B (Related lookup filters) is also incorrect because it doesn't relate to picklist values on the Opportunity object. Option D (Picklist value sets) is incorrect because it doesn't address the issue of different picklist options based on the kind of opportunity.
